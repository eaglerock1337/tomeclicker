# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TomeClicker is an open-source web-based incremental game built with SvelteKit. The game features an RPG-style progression system where players click to gain experience, level up, train stats, adventure, and eventually discover magical tomes.

### Deployment Architecture

- **Frontend**: Static SvelteKit build
  - **Preview/Staging**: GitHub Pages at `/tomeclicker` path
  - **Production**: `tomeclicker.marks.dev` via ArgoCD GitOps deployment
- **Backend** (planned): Self-hosted Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster
  - Current cluster serves `marks.dev` âœ…
  - ArgoCD for GitOps deployments
  - No shared storage currently (local PVs with node affinity)
  - Planned: Raspberry Pi 5 + NVMe storage (Linux support pending)
  - See `design/PROPOSAL.md` for detailed infrastructure plans

## Architecture

### Core Game Classes

- `Game` class (`src/lib/game.ts`): Main game state including exp, level, menu navigation, and progression conditions
- `Config` class (`src/lib/config.ts`): Handles theme and UI configuration

### Component Structure

- **Main Layout**: `src/routes/index.svelte` - Root component with responsive layout and theme system
- **Core Components**:
  - `src/lib/header.svelte` - Game header (shows when exp > 10)
  - `src/lib/navbar.svelte` - Navigation menu (shows when exp > 50)
  - `src/lib/view.svelte` - Main content area with view switching
- **Views**: `src/lib/views/` - Individual game screens (practice, settings, story)

### Game Progression System

The game uses a tiered unlock system based on experience points:

- Header unlocks at 10+ exp
- Menu navigation unlocks at 50+ exp
- Level calculation: `Math.floor(Math.log10(exp) / 3) + 1`

### Build Configuration

- Uses `@sveltejs/adapter-static` for static site generation
- **GitHub Pages**: Builds to `docs/` with `/tomeclicker` base path when `GITHUB_PAGES=true`
- **Production**: Builds to `build/` with no base path for tomeclicker.marks.dev deployment
- Prerendering enabled for all routes
- Pre-commit hooks automatically build and commit docs/ for GitHub Pages

### Theme System

- CSS custom properties-based theming
- Two themes: "prussian-blue" and "graphite"
- Light/dark mode variants for each theme
- Theme classes applied dynamically to root element

### Game Design Reference

The `design/OUTLINE.md` file contains the complete game design document with detailed progression mechanics, stats system, and future features including adventure zones, equipment, retreats, and the tome magic system.

## Development Notes

- The project uses TypeScript (game.ts, config.ts fully migrated; components partially migrated)
- Mobile-optimized with touch event handling to prevent zoom
- Test framework: Vitest with happy-dom
- Uses Vite as build tool with SvelteKit
- Svelte 5.39.6 installed but using Svelte 4 patterns (migration planned)

### Testing

- **Framework**: Vitest 3.x with happy-dom environment
- **Coverage**: Target 80%+ for core game logic (game.ts)
- **Test Structure**:
  - `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for core classes
  - `tests/integration/` - Integration tests for game flows
  - `tests/helpers/` - Test utilities and factories
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions runs tests on all pushes and PRs
- **Writing Tests**: Use the `GameBuilder` helper for creating test fixtures

### Current Project State

- **TypeScript**: Partial migration (core classes done, components need migration)
- **Svelte**: Using v5 but with v4 patterns (runes not yet adopted)
- **Architecture**: Monolithic Game class (~500 lines, needs refactoring)
- **Save System**: Basic localStorage + cookies (cloud saves planned)
- **Architecture Decision (2025-10-18)**: Hybrid state management
  - Core game logic in testable TypeScript classes
  - Svelte 5 runes for UI reactivity
  - Backend-ready for Phase 3

### Roadmap

See `design/PROPOSAL.md` for the complete modernization and enhancement roadmap, including:

- **Phase 1.x (Current)**: Immediate QoL improvements
  - Upgrades menu: Fix mobile navigation issues
  - Story page: Center layout, add navigation system
  - Settings/Saves: Polish layout, remove test buttons
- **Phase 1.5 (Next)**: Test infrastructure (ESLint, Vitest, CI/CD)
- **Phase 2**: Technical modernization (Svelte 5, TypeScript, modular architecture)
- **Phase 3**: Cloud save system on Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster

### Goals

- Iterate and flesh out game design as outlined in `design/OUTLINE.md`
- Complete migration to TypeScript and Svelte 5 (with runes)
- Implement modular class structure for better maintainability
- Deploy backend services to home Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster
- Implement cloud save system with anti-cheat validation

## Workflow & Git Strategy

### Slash Commands

**Multi-Agent Collaboration:**

- **`/1:1 <agent>`**: One-on-one meeting with a specific agent for deep domain expertise
  - Use for focused discussions, context updates, expert consultation
  - Available agents: staffy-boi, fronty-boi, gamey-boi, story-boi, docy-boi, backy-boi, sre-boi, testy-boi, secury-boi, learny-boi, designy-boi

- **`/scrum <topic>`**: Quick full-team standup for fast feedback
  - 2-4 sentences per agent, surface-level validation
  - All agents self-select based on relevance
  - Use for: "Does this sound okay?" or "Any concerns?"

- **`/huddle [agents] <topic>`**: Deep multi-agent collaboration session
  - Full team OR targeted agents, paragraphs of detailed discussion
  - Agents build on each other's ideas, in-depth problem solving
  - Use for: "Let's design this together" or "How should we approach this?"

- **`/debrief`**: Synchronize conversation context across all agent configurations
  - Updates agent files, commands, reference docs with session learnings
  - Run after scrums, huddles, 1:1s, or major decisions
  - Ensures future sessions have current context

- **`/demo <PR|branch|commit>`**: Interactive PR demonstration with live dev server
  - Walk through commits one-by-one with agent commentary
  - Test changes interactively in dev environment
  - Supports frontend, backend, and infrastructure changes

**Implementation:**

- **`/thinky-time`**: Deep work mode for comprehensive PRs with multiple file changes
  - Use for feature implementation, refactoring, migrations
  - Make logical commits authored by Claude during branch work
  - PRs will be reviewed with full commit history
  - Final merge will be squashed into user-authored commit

### Branch & PR Strategy

- Feature branches for all work
- Commits on branches are authored by Claude with signature:

  ```
  ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

  Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
  ```

- PRs maintained for session history and review
- Squash merge to main branch (final commit authored by user)
- This keeps main branch clean while preserving work history in PRs

### Code Quality Standards

When making changes, ensure:

- **TypeScript**: Strict typing, no `any` types
- **Svelte 5**: Use runes ($state, $derived, $effect) when refactoring
- **Build**: `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- **Type Check**: `npm run check` passes
- **Tests**: `npm run test:run` passes with all tests green
- **Coverage**: Maintain or improve test coverage for modified files
- **Performance**: Keep bundle sizes small (< 100KB gzipped target)
- **Mobile**: Test on mobile viewports

### Pre-commit Hooks & CI/CD

**Pre-commit Hooks** (using Husky):

The repository uses pre-commit hooks to enforce quality standards locally before code is committed:

1. Type checking (`npm run check`)
2. Linting (`npm run lint`)
3. Tests (`npm run test:run`)
4. GitHub Pages build (`GITHUB_PAGES=true npm run build`)
5. Auto-stage docs/ directory

This ensures that all commits include an up-to-date GitHub Pages build in the `docs/` directory.

**To bypass hooks** (not recommended): `git commit --no-verify`

**GitHub Actions CI/CD**:

- **Test & Validate** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`): Runs on all pushes and PRs
  - Runs type check, lint, tests, and coverage
  - Validates that docs/ is up-to-date with current build
  - Fails if pre-commit hook was bypassed and docs/ is stale
  - Uploads coverage reports to Codecov on PRs

- **Build & Deploy** (`.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml.disabled`): Future production workflow
  - Multi-arch Docker builds (arm/v7, arm64)
  - Updates happy-little-cloud K8s manifests for ArgoCD
  - Currently disabled, ready for tomeclicker.marks.dev production deployment
