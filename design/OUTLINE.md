# Tomeclicker Game Outline

This markdown file documents my overall ideas behind the game and its progression throughout the story and the magic tree.

## start of gameplay - practice page

- Click to gain EXP
- A certain number of clicks should give a level upgrade
- An upgrades page unlocks upon level 2
- Current page becomes the Practice Page going forward
- Should eventually go away after a certain time in gameplay

## upgrades page

- The first page to be unlocked after getting 100 EXP
- Includes upgrades that provide diminishing returns on active and idle EXP gameplay
- Allows for fast boost at beginning of the game but quickly have diminishing returns
- Diminishing returns should still allow for general progress throughout the game
- Allows for purchasing level-ups as below
- Also allows to unlock more pages with EXP on a scaling basis appropriate to manage gameplay experience

## level page

- Unlocked upon hitting level 2
- Level 2 should be for around 1000 EXP or so
- Further levels unlock upon an exponential basis (10x?)
- Levels also correspond to RPG game ability
- Max level will eventually be Level 20, but Level 4 is max level upon first run
- Retreats will be an eventual prestige mechanic to allow increasing level by 1 each time
- This should progress through the entire game lifecycle and should be for long-term scaling
- Upcoming levels should be previewable similar to how Antimatter Dimensions does their milestones

## study page

- The first page to unlock with EXP
- Allows for certain idle actions that can't happen while practicing
- Switching to Practice Page pauses any study action

### research

- First idle action is Research to earn idle EXP
- Is a way to get EXP without clicking
- Upgrades page eventually unlocks way to increase efficacy of this
- Upgrades should also make training and adventure benefits over time
- Research should always be available as a slow way to increase EXP as an idle action
- After studying so many times, training will be unlocked for each stat over time

### training

- The remaining study actions will be for studying each stat in order (as detailed below)
- This will spend EXP to do and can be automated for as much EXP as you have on reserve
- Training cannot be done at the same time as active Practice
- All stats start at level 0
- Based on the results of the training, EXP is gained in one or more stats
- Training should take a long time to get to level 1 of any stat
- Getting Level 1 in every stat is required to unlock adventuring
- This should feel like an unlock even to get 1 in each stat
- Training should still be useful throughout higher levels as a safe way to spend EXP over time
- Eventually allows for the safest idle action with no risk of being defeated

## adventure page

- The second page unlocked that can consume your idle action
- At this point, selecting an idle action will cancel any other from another page
- This page, however, will run at the same time as practicing (this encourages active gameplay)
- Idling can still be done by switching between research and adventure
- This page will have multiple Adventure Zones that gain AP and spend EXP to do
- You will spend AP to increase EXP for base RPG Adventure stats
- Each adventure zone has a minimum required stats (level, certain stats, total stats, etc.)
- Each adventure zone has a cost of EXP that will help scale gameplay over time
- Success involves a certain number of combats that can succeed or fail
- Failure is loss of HP, success is defeating the designated number of enemies
- Failure give a small EXP gain to a random stat
- Adventure zones will have increasingly difficult enemies with greater rewards of armor
- Each section should have armor and equipment that helps go to the next level and slowly scale
- Success gives a chance at certain level of equipment (changes of certain levels per level)
- Each Zone should have a standard tier of armor with a small chance at higher tiers
- There are additional bonuses for using a matching set of armor
- Equipment should scale with Character and Skill levels to provide a nice exponential upgrade
- Upgrades should till take time but give a satisfying feel of jumping hurdles per zone

## stats page

- This page unlocks after training is first introduced
- During training, you can simply view how much exp you have earned in each stat
- Once adventure page is unlocked, you can spend AP on each stat to increase each stat's EXP

### the stats

These are the stats that will not only be trained directly in Training but will get EXP by spending AP from Adventure Mode:

- Strength - Gives + to attack
- Agility - Gives + to attack speed
- Willpower - Gives + to defense
- Endurance - Gives + to HP
- Intelligence - Gives + to mana
- Wisdom - Gives + to mana regen

### general stats info

- All levels go from levels 0-100
- Level cap scales with current character level (e.g. Level 1 allows up to 5 each, Level 2 10 each, etc.)
- The scaling should be gradual and represent incremental performance gains
- Need to get to level 1 for each by training to unlock first Adventure Zone
- Further scaling should be achieved with level and equipment received in appropriately scaled Adventure Zones
- The first run through max Adventure Zone requires 20 of each stat and should take some time

### individual stat behavior

#### strength, agility, and willpower

- Actual stat is equal to its level
- These correspond to the primary battle stats
- Each level should provide a boost that is ultimately scaled exponentially by gear
- First stat maximum is 20 at character level 4 (stat level 20)

#### endurance and intelligence

- Actual stat is equal to 5x its level (maximum for each is 500 HP or mana at level 100)
- Starting stat maximum is 100 HP or mana at character level 4 (stat level 20)

#### wisdom

- Gives level/4 per second
- Initial maximum is 1/second at Level 4
- Corresponds to 25 seconds to recharge equal intelligence/mana level

## equipment page

- Unlocks after first equipment unlock in Adventure Mode
- Shows basic character loadout (helm, plate, leggings, gauntlets, boots, main hand, offhand)
- All equipment is unlocked, not gained in an inventory
- Each piece of equipment handles certain stat boosts (to be figured out later)
- Sets of equipment should give special bonuses that help move to next level
- Subsequent unlocks of an item gives a boost to EXP that helps prolong adventuring
- Boost received from adventure should be upgradeable in multiple ways (upgrade menu, meditation, etc.)

## retreat page

- Unlocks after unlocking a certain Adventure Zone (2nd or 3rd?)
- You gain Knowledge Points (KP) based on a scaling number of earned AP
- Retreats provide quality-of-life unlocks after a certain number of retreats
- Each reset resets EXP and stats, but provides a base earned AP scale based on total KP earned
- Each retreat increases max character level by one and max individual stat by 5

## knowledge page

- Unlocks after first retreat
- Way to spend KP from retreats
- Acts as the tech tree similar to spending Heavenly Chips in Cookie Clicker
- Early knowledge gives decent boosts to overall game stats and earning ability as well
- Each subsequent runthrough should feel faster over time
- KP can be refunded after a retreat, may need some kind of cost to do so
- Initially gives Adventure bonuses
- Eventually a pinch point for reading the Tomes of Magic
- KP is spent later on to unlocks spells & meditations learned from the Tomes

## achievements page

- Unlocks after first retreat as well
- Achievements can provide bonuses as well
- Number of achievements can provide a multiplier to all game earning abilities
- This should work similar to how Antimatter Dimensions does its achievements bonuses
- Does certain QoL improvments and helps deprecate earlier parts of the game to give advancing feel
- Does well to automate away some of the early gameplay as the game progresses

## focus page

- Unlocks after second retreat? (may need to tweak)
- Allows for meditation on certain techniques
- Meditation costs exp and takes the idle action
- Early meditations will be from adventuring, later ones from the Tomes

## quest page

**Overview**: An expensive form of adventuring that is harder and requires more enemies killed

**Unlock Requirements**:

- Unlocks after several retreats
- Requires higher character level (Level 10+)
- Adventure zones must be completed first

**Quest Structure**:

- Quest Level 1 through Quest Level 20
- Each level progressively harder, requires more enemies defeated
- Each quest level gives unique unlocks and rewards
- No death possible (safe like Adventures, but challenging)

**Level 20 Milestone**:

- Final level, Level 20, can only be reached with top stats and max-tier equipment
- Defeating the first Level 20 quest reveals the first Wizard's Notes (tome pages)
- This triggers Act III and unlocks the Tomes page

**Rewards**:

- Wizard's Notes (contain random tome pages)
- Unique unlocks and bonuses
- Preparation for Wizard Caves (endgame content)

## story page

- Unlocks after first adventure, success or failure
- Provides small chapters that describe the flow of the game
- Each page of the story reflects a stage of game unlocking
- Should allow the player to go back and relearn the lore they are unlocking
- Also acts as a loose guide as to what the player should do next

## wizard caves page

**Overview**: High-stakes endgame content for collecting tome pages

**Unlock Requirements**:

- Unlocks after first Wizard's Notes discovery (Quest Level 20)
- Requires appropriate tier equipment to enter each cave

**Cave Structure**:

- 50 Wizard Caves total (one per tome)
- 10 creatures per cave (hardest enemies in game)
- **Death is possible**: Dying = no reward, wasted time
- WoW-style gear gating: Need Tier X equipment to enter Tier X+1 caves

**Rewards**:

- Wizard's Notes with random tome pages (1-12 pages per drop)
- Tome locations:
  - **Tiers 1-4**: Fixed tome per cave (predictable progression)
  - **Tiers 5+**: Random tome pages (RNG discovery, replayability)

**Risk vs Reward**:

- High stakes: Death means losing time and getting no reward
- High reward: Tome pages for the 50 Tomes of Magic
- Preparation is critical: Top stats, best equipment, strategic spell loadout

## tomes page

**Overview**: Catalog of all 50 Tomes of Magic, organized into 15 tiers

**Unlock Requirements**:

- Unlocks after getting the first Wizard's Notes (Quest Level 20)
- A book about the Tomes catalog is discovered
- First complete tome is provided
- Portions of remaining tomes shown to preview what's to come

**Tome Structure**:

- 50 Tomes total (as defined in `ref/tomes.yaml`)
- 15 Tiers with prerequisites (as defined in `ref/tiers.yaml`)
- Each tome has 12 chapters divided into three types:
  - **Concepts (Chapters 1-3)**: Read to unlock, provides lore and theory
  - **Techniques (Chapters 4-7)**: Meditate for passive bonuses
  - **Spells (Chapters 8-12)**: Practice to awaken, use in combat

**Chapter Types Explained**:

### Concepts (Chapters 1-3)

- **Purpose**: Unlock content, teach magical theory
- **Mechanic**: Read for linear time (5-150 min depending on tier)
- **Effect**: Unlocks techniques and spells in later chapters
- **No practice required**: Just reading time investment

### Techniques (Chapters 4-7)

- **Purpose**: Meditate for passive bonuses (Progress Knight style)
- **Mechanic**: Read to unlock → Meditate (idle action) to gain mastery
- **Mastery Levels**: 0-100+ (soft cap at 100)
- **Effect**: Passive bonuses (e.g., +1% fire damage per level)
- **Level 100**: Soft goal (100+ gives diminishing returns)

### Spells (Chapters 8-12)

- **Purpose**: Practice to awaken, use in combat
- **Mechanic**: Read to unlock → Practice (idle action) to awaken → Use in Wizard Caves
- **Mastery Levels**: 0-100+ (soft cap at 100)
- **Spell Viability Curve**:
  - **0-100**: Linear awakening (spell feels weak, becomes viable)
  - **100**: Spell fully awakened (recommended minimum for combat)
  - **100+**: Diminishing returns (trailing bonuses)

**Reading Prerequisites**:

- Chapters unlock sequentially (Ch1 before Ch2, etc.)
- Some chapters have cross-tome prerequisites
- Full prerequisite tree in `ref/tomes.yaml`

**Reading Time Scaling**:

- Tier 1: 5 minutes per chapter
- Tier 5: 25 minutes per chapter
- Tier 10: 75 minutes per chapter
- Tier 15: 150 minutes per chapter
- Total: ~467 hours for all 600 chapters (upgradeable via Knowledge Points)

**Tome Progress is PERMANENT**:

- Tome pages discovered, chapters read, spell mastery **NEVER reset on prestige**
- Rationale: 467+ hour reading time would be punishing to reset
- Creates ultimate completionist content (1,000-5,000 hours total)

## other pages

- Need a settings page for game settings
- Need to allow for saving and loading games as well
- Eventually introduce a cloud saving feature that can be hosted on my site
- Implement a simple database for saving people's games through a user account
- Keep the cloud saves minimal to allow for many people to save their games for free
- Need to figure out a way to keep the cloud saves from allowing cheating
- Add a dashboard of players and stats that only include players not cheating
- Look to implement a cheating system for game testing, but to disable stats etc. online

## combat stance system

**Overview**: Strategic combat system that determines range and spell availability

**Three Stances**:

1. **Aggressive**: Rush to close range (enables melee spells)
2. **Balanced**: Maintain mid-range (tactical flexibility)
3. **Defensive**: Stay at long range (maximize safety)

**Stance Matrix** (Player Stance + Enemy Stance = Combat Range):

- Aggressive + Aggressive = Long Range (both engage at distance)
- Aggressive + Balanced = Mid Range
- Aggressive + Defensive = Melee Range
- Balanced + Balanced = Mid Range
- Balanced + Defensive = Mid Range
- Defensive + Defensive = Long Range (both keep distance)

**Range Progression**:

- Combat always starts at Long Range
- Progresses: Long → Mid → Melee as battle continues
- Stance determines starting range and progression speed
- Can change stance between enemy fights (resets combat to Long Range)

**Spell Ranges**:

- **Long Range**: Long-range spells only (Fire Bolt, Lightning Strike)
- **Mid Range**: Mid-range spells (Fire Wave, Ice Shard)
- **Melee Range**: Touch spells (Fire Hand, Shocking Grasp)

**Strategic Depth**:

- Match stance to spell loadout
- Example: Fire mage with long-range spells → Defensive stance
- Example: Melee spell build → Aggressive stance
- Example: Hybrid build → Balanced stance

## element/alignment mastery system

**Overview**: Two-layer mastery system from practicing spells

**Layer 1: Mastery Bonuses**

- Practicing spells of an element/alignment increases mastery level (0-100+)
- Example: Practicing Fire Hand, Fire Bolt, Fire Wave → Fire Mastery increases
- Effect: +X% damage/effectiveness for all spells of that element
- Cap: Level 100 (soft cap, 100+ gives diminishing returns)

**Layer 2: Advanced Spell Unlocks**

- Higher-tier tomes require mastery thresholds
- Example: Tome 20 (Advanced Fire Magic) requires Fire Mastery 50+
- Example: Tome 45 (Balance) requires Holy Mastery 75+ AND Black Mastery 75+
- Purpose: Gates advanced content, rewards focused progression

**Elements (6 total)**:

1. Fire
2. Frost
3. Shock (Lightning)
4. Earth
5. Air
6. Water

**Alignments (2 total)**:

1. Holy (Light)
2. Black (Dark/Shadow)

**Rock-Paper-Scissors Combat**:

- Fire > Frost > Shock > Fire (elemental triangle)
- Holy vs Black (oppositional, mutually effective)

**Spectral vs Elemental (Tier 10+ Choice)**:

- **Spectral Path**: No element, defensive focus, protective spells
- **Elemental Path**: All 6 elements, offensive focus, damage spells
- **Mutually Exclusive**: Can only choose ONE until Tome 49 (Transcendence)
- **Tome 49**: Unlocks BOTH Spectral and Elemental (endgame unification)

## tier progression and restrictions

**15 Tiers, 50 Tomes** (see `ref/tiers.yaml` for complete structure)

### Tier 1-5: Foundation (Tomes 1-20)

- Open progression, minimal restrictions
- Learn basic elements and alignments
- Tier 1-4: Fixed tome locations in Wizard Caves
- Tier 5+: Random tome page drops

### Tier 6: Alignment Restriction (Tomes 21-24)

- **Restriction**: Choose ONE alignment (Holy OR Black)
- **Locked Until**: Tome 45 (Balance) lifts restriction
- **Impact**: Prevents mixing light and dark magic early
- **Narrative**: Moral choice, commitment to path

### Tier 10: Spectral vs Elemental Fork (Tomes 35-37)

- **Restriction**: Choose Spectral (defensive) OR Elemental (offensive)
- **Locked Until**: Tome 49 (Transcendence) lifts restriction
- **Spectral**: No element, protective spells, defensive mastery
- **Elemental**: All 6 elements, offensive spells, damage mastery
- **Impact**: Defines playstyle for Tiers 10-14

### Tier 14: Balance (Tome 45)

- **Effect**: Lifts Tier 6 alignment restriction
- **Enables**: Holy + Black magic simultaneously
- **Prerequisite**: High mastery in both alignments (75+ each)
- **Narrative**: Achieving balance between light and dark

### Tier 15: Transcendence and Creation (Tomes 49-50)

- **Tome 49**: Lifts Tier 10 restriction (gain BOTH Spectral and Elemental)
- **Tome 50**: Custom spell creation (endgame sandbox)
- **Narrative**: Transcending limitations, becoming a true master

**Prerequisite System**:

- Each tier requires completing previous tier
- Some tiers require minimum number of tomes from previous tier
- Example: Tier 6 requires at least 2 Tier 5 tomes completed
- Cross-tome chapter prerequisites (see `ref/tomes.yaml`)

## three-act game structure

### Act I: The Clicker (0-4 Retreats, ~10-20 hours)

- **Focus**: Practice → Upgrades → Stats → Adventure → Equipment
- **Core Loop**: Click for EXP, buy upgrades, train stats, adventure for gear
- **Max Level**: 4-5 on first run, progressing to Level 10-12 by Act II
- **Goal**: Unlock all basic Adventure Zones, build stat foundation
- **Feel**: Exponential power growth, classic incremental gameplay

### Act II: The Quester (4-16 Retreats, ~50-200 hours)

- **Focus**: Quest system → Knowledge Point optimization → Achievement hunting
- **Core Loop**: Quests unlock at higher levels, provide unique rewards
- **Max Level**: 16-20 (Level 20 requires significant progression)
- **EXP Relevance**: EXP becomes obsolete after ~16 Retreats, replaced by AP/KP focus
- **Goal**: Complete Quest system, prepare for Tomes
- **Feel**: Strategic depth, long-term optimization

### Act III: The Mage (16+ Retreats, 100-1000+ hours)

- **Focus**: 50 Tomes of Magic → Spell Mastery → Wizard Caves → Transcendence
- **Core Loop**: Discover tome pages, read chapters, practice spells, master elements
- **Max Level**: Level 20+ (stats continue scaling)
- **Goal**: Master all 50 Tomes, complete Tome 50 (custom spell creation)
- **Feel**: Completionist endgame, deep mastery systems
- **Total Completion**: 1,000-5,000 hours for true mastery

**Key Insight**: EXP is the primary currency in Act I-II, but becomes obsolete in Act III. The game evolves from incremental clicker to RPG progression to magical mastery.

## zone retirement system

**Overview**: Long-term completionist goals for Adventure Zones

**Mechanic**:

- After completing 10→20→30+ Adventure Zones, retire zones for permanent upgrades
- Retired zones provide passive bonuses (e.g., +5% click multiplier)
- Scaling: 10 zones for first boost, 20 for second, 30 for third, etc.

**Purpose**:

- Creates long-term passive progression
- Rewards exploration and completion
- Provides ongoing goals beyond main progression

## what happens after?

**Endgame Vision**:

- A hierarchy map of the 50 Tomes and the skills learned therein
- Reading pages of the Tomes costs EXP and time (467+ hours total)
- Wizard Caves provide challenging high-stakes combat for tome pages
- Each Wizard Cave completed reveals more tome pages
- Eventually, all 50 tomes will be unlocked
- Mastering all tomes allows casting of pure magical force
- The story reveals that these Tomes are all that is left from a magical civilization lost to time
- Tome 50 describes how to create your own custom magic (endgame sandbox)
- After mastering creation itself... the journey continues with player-created content

**The Lost Civilization Mystery**:

- These tomes are all that remains of a world that mastered magic
- The authors are long dead, but their knowledge lives on
- They sought to control magic absolutely—and paid the ultimate price
- Final revelation: The civilization didn't fall. They transcended. And now, so can you.
