# Tomeclicker Game Outline

This markdown file documents my overall ideas behind the game and its progression throughout the story and the magic tree.

## start of gameplay - practice page

- Click to gain EXP
- A certain number of clicks should give a level upgrade
- An upgrades page unlocks upon level 2
- Current page becomes the Practice Page going forward
- Should eventually go away after a certain time in gameplay

## upgrades page

- The first page to be unlocked after getting 50 EXP
- Includes upgrades that provide diminishing returns on active and idle EXP gameplay
- Allows for fast boost at beginning of the game but quickly have diminishing returns
- Diminishing returns should still allow for general progress throughout the game
- Allows for purchasing level-ups as below
- Also allows to unlock more pages with EXP on a scaling basis appropriate to manage gameplay experience

### leveling up

- Unlocked upon hitting level 2
- Level 2 should be for around 1000 EXP or so
- Further levels unlock upon an exponential basis (10x?)
- Levels also correspond to RPG game ability
- Max level will eventually be Level 20, but Level 5 is max level upon first run
- Retreats will be an eventual prestige mechanic to allow increasing level by 1 each time
- This should progress through the entire game lifecycle and should be for long-term scaling
- Upcoming levels should be previewable similar to how Antimatter Dimensions does their milestones

## study page

- The first page to unlock with EXP
- Allows for certain idle actions that can't happen while practicing
- Switching to Practice Page pauses any study action

### research

- First idle action is Research to earn idle EXP
- Is a way to get EXP without clicking
- Upgrades page eventually unlocks way to increase efficacy of this
- Upgrades should also make training and adventure benefits over time
- Research should always be available as a slow way to increase EXP as an idle action
- After studying so many times, training will be unlocked for each stat over time

### training

- The remaining study actions will be for studying each stat in order (as detailed below)
- This will spend EXP to do and can be automated for as much EXP as you have on reserve
- Training cannot be done at the same time as active Practice
- All stats start at level 0
- Based on the results of the training, EXP is gained in one or more stats
- Training should take a long time to get to level 1 of any stat
- Getting Level 1 in every stat is required to unlock adventuring
- This should feel like an unlock even to get 1 in each stat
- Training should still be useful throughout higher levels as a safe way to spend EXP over time
- Eventually allows for the safest idle action with no risk of being defeated

## adventure page

- The second page unlocked that can consume your idle action
- At this point, selecting an idle action will cancel any other from another page
- This page, however, will run at the same time as practicing (this encourages active gameplay)
- Idling can still be done by switching between research and adventure
- This page will have multiple Adventure Zones that gain AP and spend EXP to do
- You will spend AP to increase EXP for base RPG Adventure stats
- Each adventure zone has a minimum required stats (level, certain stats, total stats, etc.)
- Each adventure zone has a cost of EXP that will help scale gameplay over time
- Success involves a certain number of combats that can succeed or fail
- Failure is loss of HP, success is defeating the designated number of enemies
- Failure give a small EXP gain to a random stat
- Adventure zones will have increasingly difficult enemies with greater rewards of armor
- Each section should have armor and equipment that helps go to the next level and slowly scale
- Success gives a chance at certain level of equipment (changes of certain levels per level)
- Each Zone should have a standard tier of armor with a small chance at higher tiers
- There are additional bonuses for using a matching set of armor
- Equipment should scale with Character and Skill levels to provide a nice exponential upgrade
- Upgrades should till take time but give a satisfying feel of jumping hurdles per zone

## stats page

- This page unlocks after training is first introduced
- During training, you can simply view how much exp you have earned in each stat
- Once adventure page is unlocked, you can spend AP on each stat to increase each stat's EXP

### the stats

These are the stats that will not only be trained directly in Training but will get EXP by spending AP from Adventure Mode:

- Strength - Gives + to attack
- Agility - Gives + to attack speed
- Willpower - Gives + to defense
- Endurance - Gives + to HP
- Intelligence - Gives + to mana
- Wisdom - Gives + to mana regen

### general stats info

- All levels go from levels 0-100
- Level cap scales with current character level (e.g. Level 1 allows up to 5 each, Level 2 10 each, etc.)
- The scaling should be gradual and represent incremental performance gains
- Need to get to level 1 for each by training to unlock first Adventure Zone
- Further scaling should be achieved with level and equipment received in appropriately scaled Adventure Zones
- The first run through max Adventure Zone requires 20 of each stat and should take some time

### individual stat behavior

#### strength, agility, and willpower

- Actual stat is equal to its level
- These correspond to the primary battle stats
- Each level should provide a boost that is ultimately scaled exponentially by gear
- First stat maximum is 20 at character level 4 (stat level 20)

#### endurance and intelligence

- Actual stat is equal to 5x its level (maximum for each is 500 HP or mana at level 100)
- Starting stat maximum is 100 HP or mana at character level 4 (stat level 20)

#### wisdom

- Gives level/4 per second
- Initial maximum is 1/second at Level 4
- Corresponds to 25 seconds to recharge equal intelligence/mana level

## equipment page

- Unlocks after first equipment unlock in Adventure Mode
- Shows basic character loadout (helm, plate, leggings, gauntlets, boots, main hand, offhand)
- All equipment is unlocked, not gained in an inventory
- Each piece of equipment handles certain stat boosts (to be figured out later)
- Sets of equipment should give special bonuses that help move to next level
- Subsequent unlocks of an item gives a boost to EXP that helps prolong adventuring
- Boost received from adventure should be upgradeable in multiple ways (upgrade menu, meditation, etc.)

## retreat page

- Unlocks after unlocking a certain Adventure Zone (2nd or 3rd?)
- You gain Knowledge Points (KP) based on a scaling number of earned AP
- Retreats provide quality-of-life unlocks after a certain number of retreats
- Each reset resets EXP and stats, but provides a base earned AP scale based on total KP earned
- Each retreat increases max character level by one and max individual stat by 5

## knowledge page

- Unlocks after first retreat
- Way to spend KP from retreats
- Acts as the tech tree similar to spending Heavenly Chips in Cookie Clicker
- Early knowledge gives decent boosts to overall game stats and earning ability as well
- Each subsequent runthrough should feel faster over time
- KP can be refunded after a retreat, may need some kind of cost to do so
- Initially gives Adventure bonuses
- Eventually a pinch point for reading the Tomes of Magic
- KP is spent later on to unlocks spells & meditations learned from the Tomes

## achievements page

- Unlocks after first retreat as well
- Achievements can provide bonuses as well
- Number of achievements can provide a multiplier to all game earning abilities
- This should work similar to how Antimatter Dimensions does its achievements bonuses
- Does certain QoL improvments and helps deprecate earlier parts of the game to give advancing feel
- Does well to automate away some of the early gameplay as the game progresses

## focus page

- Unlocks after second retreat? (may need to tweak)
- Allows for meditation on certain techniques
- Meditation costs exp and takes the idle action
- Early meditations will be from adventuring, later ones from the Tomes

## quest page

- Unlocks after certain number of retreats?
- An expensive form of adventuring that is harder and requires more enemies killed
- Each level gives unique boosts (unlock-style)
- Final level, Level 20, can only be reached with top stats
- Defeating the first level 20 quest reveals the first collection of Tomes of Magic pages

## story page

- Unlocks after first adventure, success or failure
- Provides small chapters that describe the flow of the game
- Each page of the story reflects a stage of game unlocking
- Should allow the player to go back and relearn the lore they are unlocking
- Also acts as a loose guide as to what the player should do next

## tomes page

- Unlocks after getting the first pages of the Tomes of Magic
- Shows a catalog of all 50 Tomes of Magic (as outlined in tomes.yaml)
- Tomes are usable in tiers (as outlined in tiers.yaml)

## what happens after?

- A hierarchy map of skills learned from the Tomes of Magic
- Lets you read the pages of the Tomes for EXP
- This is where the plan gets hazy but this is where the depth of the story will come
