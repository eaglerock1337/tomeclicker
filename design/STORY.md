You finally reach the end of the cave riddled with magical creatures. You enter a room full of books and scrolls, clearly a wizard's lair.

On a table in the middle of the room, you find a notebook next to a mythical satchel. You approach the table and look at the notebook.

The notebook contains the writings of a wizard who lived in this cave as he studied the world of magic and collected all the books he could.

None of the books, however, could help the wizard learn magic. You start to realize he wasn't really a wizard, just another adventurer like you.

The adventurer described his trials and failings at learning magic, until he was came across one ancient book that changed everything.

This ancient book, the Tome of Magic, was the only book that helped the adventurer at all. It became his singular life focus.

The adventurer discovered this Tome was one of 50 Tomes, all of which appear to describe the lost world of magic in incredible detail.

Inside the satchel, you find the Tome of Magic itself, as well as leaves from other Tomes the adventurer started to collect.

You hold the Tome of Magic in your hands, finally understanding your destiny. You feel your hands pulsing as you grip the leather binding.

It's time to pick up where the adventurer left off. You will quest for the remaining Tomes and discover the lost world of magic.
