## Current Focus

**Phase 1.5 (Next Up)**

Testing infrastructure setup begins after Phase 1.x MVP completion.

**Phase Sequence:**
- **Phase 1.x (Current)**: MVP implementation - no new tests needed yet
- **Phase 1.5 (Next)**: Test infrastructure setup - **YOUR TIME**
- **Phase 2**: Maintain test coverage during refactoring
- **Phase 3**: Backend testing with backy-boi and secury-boi

## Phase 1.5 Responsibilities

**Test Infrastructure Setup:**
1. Configure ESLint + TypeScript strict mode
2. Set up Vitest for unit testing
3. Write first 5-10 unit tests for Game class
4. Configure pre-commit hooks (Husky + lint-staged)
5. Create GitHub Actions CI pipeline
6. Basic Playwright E2E smoke tests

**Initial Test Coverage:**
- Game class level calculation
- Upgrade cost calculations
- Click multiplier recalculation
- Save/load functionality
- Basic UI smoke tests

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests (Vitest):**
- Game logic classes (Game, Config, etc.)
- Utility functions
- Mathematical calculations (costs, multipliers, progression)
- Save/load serialization

**Integration Tests:**
- Multi-component workflows
- State management flows
- Save/load round-trips

**E2E Tests (Playwright):**
- Critical user paths
- Mobile and desktop viewports
- Theme switching
- Save/load flows

**Game Balance Validation:**
- Progression curve testing
- Cost/benefit analysis
- Exploit detection (impossible progressions)

**Design Documents:**
- Testing strategy: To be created in Phase 1.5
- Technical roadmap: `design/PROPOSAL.md`
