## Current Focus

**Phase 1.5 & Phase 2 (In Progress)** âœ…

Testing infrastructure is established! Currently leading Game class refactoring with test-driven development.

**Recent Major Work (2025-10-25):**

- âœ… Test infrastructure fully established (Vitest, pre-commit hooks, CI/CD)
- âœ… IdleActionManager extraction with 98.87% coverage (32 tests)
- âœ… UpgradeManager extraction with 100% coverage (34 tests)
- âœ… Game.ts refactored from 1316 â†’ 884 lines (-32.8%)
- âœ… Total test suite: 334 tests, project-wide 80% coverage

**Next Up:**

- Extract Save/Load system (remove encryption, simplify to JSON)
- Continue Game class modularization
- Target: 80%+ coverage maintained throughout refactoring

**Phase Sequence:**

- **Phase 1.x**: âœ… MVP implementation complete
- **Phase 1.5**: âœ… Test infrastructure setup complete
- **Phase 2 (Current)**: Game class refactoring with TDD
- **Phase 3**: Backend testing with backy-boi and secury-boi

## Phase 1.5 Responsibilities

**Test Infrastructure Setup:**

1. Configure ESLint + TypeScript strict mode
2. Set up Vitest for unit testing
3. Write first 5-10 unit tests for Game class
4. Configure pre-commit hooks (Husky + lint-staged)
5. Create GitHub Actions CI pipeline
6. Basic Playwright E2E smoke tests

**Initial Test Coverage:**

- Game class level calculation
- Upgrade cost calculations
- Click multiplier recalculation
- Save/load functionality
- Basic UI smoke tests

---

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests (Vitest):** âœ… Established

- âœ… Game logic classes (Game, Config, calculations, format)
- âœ… Manager classes (IdleActionManager, UpgradeManager)
- âœ… Utility functions (100% coverage on utils)
- âœ… Mathematical calculations (costs, multipliers, progression)
- ðŸ”„ Save/load serialization (next target)

**Test Coverage Achievements:**

- `calculations.ts`: 100% coverage (33 tests)
- `format.ts`: 100% coverage (114 tests)
- `config.ts`: 97.36% coverage (62 tests)
- `IdleActionManager`: 98.87% coverage (32 tests)
- `UpgradeManager`: 100% coverage (34 tests)
- **Project-wide**: 80% statements, 91.5% branches

**Integration Tests:**

- Multi-component workflows
- State management flows
- Save/load round-trips (to be added with SaveManager)

**E2E Tests (Playwright):**

- Critical user paths (future)
- Mobile and desktop viewports (future)
- Theme switching (future)
- Save/load flows (future)

**Game Balance Validation:**

- Progression curve testing (future)
- Cost/benefit analysis (future)
- Exploit detection (impossible progressions) (future)

## Refactoring Patterns Established (2025-10-25)

**Strangler Fig Pattern:**

- Extract manager class alongside Game class
- Move initialization, business logic, state to manager
- Game class becomes thin facade that delegates
- Maintain all tests green throughout extraction

**Manager Architecture:**

- Dependency Injection via constructor
- Result Pattern for state mutations (return objects, don't mutate)
- Single Responsibility (each manager handles one domain)
- 95%+ test coverage target for all managers

**Managers Created:**

1. `IdleActionManager` - Training, meditation, osmosis logic
2. `UpgradeManager` - Upgrade definitions, costs, purchases
3. `SaveManager` - Next up (save/load/migration) - **REMOVE ENCRYPTION**

**Test Coverage Strategy:**

- Write comprehensive tests during extraction (not after)
- Test all paths: success, failure, edge cases
- Use builder pattern for test fixtures
- Target 95%+ coverage on extracted managers

**Design Documents:**

- Testing infrastructure: âœ… Complete (Vitest, Husky, CI/CD)
- Technical roadmap: `design/PROPOSAL.md`
