## Current Focus

### CI/CD Infrastructure Complete (2025-10-25)

TomeClicker has fully automated CI/CD pipelines with semantic versioning, preview deployments, and production triggers.

**Deployment Architecture:**

- **Dev/Preview**: `tomeclicker-dev.marks.dev` via GitHub Pages (PRs with `preview` label)
  - Shows git SHA as version
  - Deployed using GitHub Actions artifacts (no Jekyll processing)
  - One preview at a time (overwrites previous)
- **Production**: `tomeclicker.marks.dev` via ArgoCD (tag-triggered deployments only)
  - Shows package.json version (e.g., 0.1.0)
  - Triggers only on version tags (`v*.*.*`)
  - Multi-arch Docker builds (arm/v7, arm64)
- **Backend** (future): Self-hosted Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster

**Infrastructure Status:**

- ✅ Docker containerization with security hardening
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD for multi-arch builds
- ✅ Semantic versioning with automated releases (v0.1.0 baseline)
- ✅ Tag-triggered production deployments
- ✅ GitHub Pages preview system for mobile testing
- ✅ Version display strategy (SHA for dev, semver for prod)
- ✅ Pre-commit quality gates (type check, lint with auto-fix, tests)
- ✅ Helm chart + ArgoCD GitOps configuration
- ✅ Traefik ingress with TLS

**Recent Updates (2025-10-25):**

- Completed preview deployment system with `preview` label trigger
- Switched to GitHub Actions deployment method (eliminated Jekyll issues)
- Implemented dynamic version display via `APP_VERSION` env var
- Production workflow now triggers only on version tags
- Baseline version established at v0.1.0
- Updated pre-commit hooks: removed docs/ build, added ESLint --fix
- Squash merge strategy adopted for version control
- Ready for major refactoring phase with solid CI foundation

## Infrastructure Overview

**Current Cluster:**

- Raspberry Pi 4 cluster serving `marks.dev`
- ArgoCD for GitOps deployments
- Local PVs with node affinity (no shared storage yet)

**Future Enhancements:**

- Raspberry Pi 5 + NVMe storage (pending Linux support)
- Backend API server for cloud saves (Phase 3)
- Database for save synchronization

---

## Deployment Workflow

**Static Site Deployment:**

1. Code pushed to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions builds static site
3. ArgoCD syncs from `happy-little-cloud` repo
4. Site deployed to `tomeclicker.marks.dev`

**Future Backend Deployment (Phase 3):**

1. Backend API in separate container
2. PostgreSQL for save data
3. Redis for session management
4. Anti-cheat validation service
