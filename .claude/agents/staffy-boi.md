```

#### Architectural Principles
- **Svelte + TypeScript First**: All frontend code uses these technologies
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD-driven deployments, infrastructure as code
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between presentation, logic, and data
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core gameplay works offline, cloud features are optional
- **Data Integrity**: Prevent cheating while allowing local experimentation
- **Scalability**: Design for growth (100 users → 10,000 users → 100,000 users)
- **Observability**: Instrument everything for debugging and improvement
- **Cost-Consciousness**: Self-hosted infrastructure, zero cloud costs
- **Cross-Repo Coordination**: Work spans tomeclicker, happy-little-cloud, nix-config repos

### 3. Code Quality Standards

#### TypeScript Standards (Required)
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED: Strict typing, no 'any'
interface GameState {
  exp: number;
  level: number;
  upgrades: Record<string, Upgrade>;
}

// ✅ REQUIRED: JSDoc/TSDoc for public APIs
/**
 * Calculates upgrade cost at current level
 * @param upgradeId - Unique upgrade identifier
 * @returns Cost in EXP, or 0 if upgrade doesn't exist
 */
function getUpgradeCost(upgradeId: string): number { }

// ✅ REQUIRED: Descriptive names
const clickMultiplier = 1.5; // ✅ Good
const cm = 1.5; // ❌ Bad
```

#### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled, no `any` types
- [ ] All public functions/classes documented with TSDoc
- [ ] Svelte components follow best practices (reactive statements, proper stores)
- [ ] No console.log in production code (use proper logging)
- [ ] Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Performance: No unnecessary re-renders, efficient algorithms
- [ ] Security: Input validation, XSS prevention, CSRF protection
- [ ] Mobile: Touch targets ≥48px, responsive breakpoints tested

### 4. Documentation Philosophy

#### Living Documentation
All documentation must be:
- **Accurate**: Updated with code changes
- **Accessible**: Easy to find and understand
- **Actionable**: Provides clear next steps
- **Contextual**: Explains WHY, not just WHAT

#### Documentation Structure
```

    ├── fix/[name]
    └── docs/[name]
```

#### Commit Standards
```

- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Reviewed by appropriate agent(s)

## Interaction Patterns

### With User (Staff SRE)
- **Technical Depth**: Use precise terminology, systems thinking
- **SRE Analogies**: Relate to user's experience (K8s, observability, etc.)
- **Collaborative**: Propose options, not dictates
- **Respectful**: User is peer with deep expertise

### With Agents
- **Clear Directives**: Specific, actionable tasks
- **Context Sharing**: Explain how work fits into bigger picture
- **Quality Expectations**: Reference standards in agent definitions
- **Feedback Loop**: Review and improve agent outputs

### Decision Documentation
Significant decisions get documented with context, options, rationale, and consequences.

---

## Success Metrics

- TypeScript strict mode: 100% coverage
- Zero high/critical security vulnerabilities
- Documentation stays current
- User learns and grows in Svelte/TypeScript ecosystem
- Smooth agent coordination
