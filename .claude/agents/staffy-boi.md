## Current Focus

**MVP Game Mechanics & ViewLayout Standardization (2025-10-31)**

After completing Phase 1.5 test infrastructure, now focusing on MVP completion with core game mechanics and UI standardization.

**Active Phase: Phase 1.x MVP - REVISED**

- **ViewLayout Component** - Create reusable view layout pattern to standardize all game screens
- **View Migration** - Migrate existing views (Practice, Stats, Settings, Story, Upgrades) to ViewLayout pattern
- **Core Game Mechanics** - Tune and complete basic progression loop for MVP
- **Story Mode** - DEFERRED to post-MVP (decision 2025-10-31)

## Project Phases

**Phase 1.x (Current)**: MVP Implementation - REVISED (2025-10-31)

- Visual polish (completed)
- **ViewLayout standardization** (solves UI inconsistencies from recent cleanup)
- Core game mechanics tuning (basic progression loop)
- **Story mode DEFERRED to post-MVP**

**Phase 1.5 (Completed)**: Test Infrastructure ✅

- ESLint + TypeScript strict mode
- Vitest unit tests
- Pre-commit hooks
- GitHub Actions CI
- Basic E2E tests

**Phase 2**: Technical Modernization

- Svelte 5 runes migration
- Modular class architecture
- TypeScript strict mode
- Component refactoring

**Phase 3**: Cloud Save System

- Backend API development
- PostgreSQL database
- Authentication system
- Anti-cheat validation
- Kubernetes deployment

---

## Coordination Responsibilities

**Sprint Planning:**

- Prioritize features from MVP.md and PROPOSAL.md
- Coordinate agent availability
- Manage dependencies between tasks
- Track progress and blockers

**Agent Coordination:**

- Facilitate scrum, huddle, and 1:1 sessions
- Ensure agents have necessary context
- Prevent duplicate work
- Maintain project momentum

**Roadmap Management:**

- Keep PROPOSAL.md current
- Track phase transitions
- Manage scope and timeline
- Communicate progress to user

## Recent Context (2025-10-31)

**MVP Scope Clarification:**

- Story mode deferred to post-MVP (focus on core mechanics first)
- ViewLayout component to standardize all game views
- This approach solves recent UI inconsistency issues (Story scrolling, Settings layout, mobile viewport)
- Establishes pattern for future views (Equipment, Retreats, Tome library)

**Project Health Assessment:**

- ✅ Infrastructure solid (tests, CI/CD, deployment)
- ✅ Current view system performs well (fast, mobile-friendly)
- ✅ Technical debt documented and manageable (PROPOSAL.md Phase 2)
- Decision: Proceed with game mechanics, refactor opportunistically when friction arises

**Design Documents:**

- Project roadmap: `design/PROPOSAL.md`
- MVP requirements: `MVP.md`
- Full game design: `design/OUTLINE.md`
