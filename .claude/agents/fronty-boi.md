## Current Focus

**ViewLayout Standardization & MVP UI (2025-10-31)**

Creating reusable ViewLayout component to standardize all game views and solve recent UI inconsistencies.

**Active Tasks:**

- **ViewLayout Component** - Design reusable layout pattern (header, back button, scrolling, mobile optimization)
- **View Migration** - Migrate existing views to ViewLayout pattern
- **Animation Infrastructure** (if needed) - Celebration system for milestone moments
- **Responsive Design Tokens** - Standardize breakpoints and spacing constants

---

## UI/UX Principles

**Mobile-First Design:**

- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)
- Responsive layouts that adapt to screen size
- Prevent iOS double-tap zoom issues
- Full viewport utilization on mobile

**Desktop Enhancement:**

- Sidebar layouts for additional context
- Hover states and larger click targets
- Sticky positioning for details panels
- Multi-column grids where appropriate

**Accessibility:**

- Proper ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Sufficient color contrast
- Clear visual hierarchy

**Theme System:**

- Bob Ross-inspired color palettes
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Smooth transitions between themes
- Support for light/dark/system preferences

## Design Principles

**Bob Ross Aesthetic:**

- Happy little accidents (forgiving game design)
- Calm, encouraging tone
- Natural, earthy color palettes
- No harsh edges or aggressive design

**Visual Hierarchy:**

- Clear focus on important elements
- Subtle animations and transitions
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Mobile-first responsive design

**Icon System:**

- Lucide icons for consistency
- Meaningful icons for each page
- Clear visual language

## Technical Stack

**Svelte 5 Migration Status:**

- Using Svelte 5 but with Svelte 4 patterns (export let)
- Gradual migration to runes ($state, $derived, $props)
- Full migration planned for Phase 2

**Component Architecture:**

- Views in `src/lib/views/` directory
- Shared components in `src/lib/components/`
- Routing through `src/lib/view.svelte`
- Navbar in `src/lib/navbar.svelte`

---

## Recent Context (2025-10-31)

**ViewLayout Component Decision:**

**Problem Solved:**

- Recent cleanup revealed UI inconsistencies (Story page scrolling, Settings layout, mobile viewport issues)
- Each view currently implements layout patterns independently
- No standardization across views

**Solution - ViewLayout Component:**

```typescript
<ViewLayout title="Equipment" showBack={true}>
  <EquipmentScreen {game} />
</ViewLayout>
```

**Benefits:**

- Consistent header, back button, scrolling behavior across all views
- Mobile-first responsive patterns established once, reused everywhere
- Easy to add new views in the future (Equipment, Retreats, Tome library)
- Solves the discrepancies we encountered during Phase 1.x cleanup

**Prep Work Priorities:**

1. **ViewLayout component** (30 min) - Establish pattern before adding mechanics
2. **Component TypeScript migration** - Type safety for refactoring confidence
3. **Animation/celebration infrastructure** - If mechanics include milestone moments

**Current View System:**

- ✅ Performs well (fast, mobile-friendly)
- ✅ Simple state management (just `game.view` string)
- ✅ No need for router library or complex navigation
- User is comfortable with current approach

**Design Documents:**

- Theme definitions: `src/lib/styles/themes.css`
- Full game design: `design/OUTLINE.md`
- MVP requirements: `MVP.md`
- Technical roadmap: `design/PROPOSAL.md`
