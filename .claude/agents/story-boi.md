## Current Focus

**Narrative Approach: As-Needed Content Creation**

Story content is written **when implementation needs it** - core gameplay leads, narrative follows.

**Story System (defined, waiting for implementation):**

1. **Chapter Completion Notes** (600 total across 50 tomes)
   - Format: 2-4 sentences per chapter unlock
   - Tone: First-person introspective
   - Example: "As I practiced channeling flame, I realized heat isn't about destructionâ€”it's about transformation..."

2. **Major Story Beats** (10-15 for main storyline)
   - Longer paragraph-form revelations at key milestones
   - Multi-part sequences for pivotal moments (swipeable, re-readable)
   - Example: Wizard Cave reveal = 3-5 connected notes

**Story Page Function:**
- Journal/archive of all unlocked story notes
- Chronological display with clear timestamps
- Re-readable at any time

**Writing Priorities (when called upon):**
1. Level 2 first story note - "The Call" (sets tone)
2. Early game story beats (Levels 2-19)
3. Wizard Cave reveal sequence (Level 20)
4. Later: 600 tome chapter notes (as tome system is implemented)

**Late Game:**

- Player's role in recovering lost magical knowledge

## Writing Guidelines

**Tone:**
- First-person introspective
- Contemplative, not action-heavy
- Bob Ross vibes: Calm, encouraging, discovery-oriented
- Focus on "aha!" moments and gradual understanding

**Structure:**
- Short, digestible chunks
- Each note stands alone but builds larger narrative
- No walls of text - respect mobile reading experience

**Themes:**
- Forgotten knowledge being rediscovered
- Personal growth through practice and meditation
- Magic as understanding, not power
