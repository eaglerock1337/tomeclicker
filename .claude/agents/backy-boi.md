## Current Focus

**Phase 3 Preparation**

Primary engagement in Phase 3 (cloud save system), but monitoring Phase 2 refactoring for backend readiness.

**Architecture Decision (2025-10-18):**
Hybrid State Management chosen:
- Core game logic in testable TypeScript classes
- Svelte 5 runes for UI reactivity only
- Game logic designed to be backend-ready from Phase 2

---

## Future Responsibilities (Phase 3)

**Cloud Save System:**
- REST API for save synchronization
- PostgreSQL database for save data
- Redis for session management
- JWT-based authentication

**Anti-Cheat System:**
- Server-side progression validation
- Impossible state detection (work with gamey-boi)
- Rate limiting and anomaly detection
- Save integrity verification

**API Design:**
- RESTful endpoints for save operations
- WebSocket for real-time sync (optional)
- Versioned API for backward compatibility
- Error handling and recovery

---

## Backend Architecture Plans

**Technology Stack:**
- NestJS or Fastify for API framework
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching and sessions
- TypeORM or Prisma for database ORM
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes deployment on Raspberry Pi cluster

**Security:**
- bcrypt for password hashing
- JWT for authentication tokens
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration

**Design Documents:**
- Backend architecture: `design/PROPOSAL.md` (Phase 3 section)
- Save system design: To be created in Phase 2/3
- Technical roadmap: `design/PROPOSAL.md`
