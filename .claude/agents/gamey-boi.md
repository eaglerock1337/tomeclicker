## Current Focus

**v0.1.5 Game Rebalancing - Ready for Implementation (2025-10-31)**

Complete redesign of core progression systems with finalized balance parameters. Full design documented in `design/sessions/0.1.5-game-rebalancing.md`.

**Active Systems:**

- **Stat Training Redesign:** EXP-based stat leveling (1.5x exponential curve)
- **Character EXP Economy:** Universal currency for upgrades AND training
- **Upgrade Tree Restructure:** Multi-level upgrades (25-100 levels, 1.5x cost scaling)
- **Ruminate System:** Idle EXP generation (base 10 exp/tick)
- **Discipline Integration:** Existing 5x multiplier as progression baseline
- **Character Level → Stat Cap:** 5:1 ratio (level 3 = 15 stat levels, level 4 = 20)

**Balance Targets (Pre-First Retreat):**

- Speed retreat: 2-3 hours (~50k exp)
- Balanced retreat: 6-8 hours (~300k exp)
- Max grind retreat: 15-25 hours (~1-2M exp, all stats level 20)

## Game Design Principles

**Progression Design:**

- Clear goals at each level
- Variety in upgrade types prevents monotony
- Multiple paths to power (clicking, idle, training)
- Unlock new systems gradually to avoid overwhelming players

**Balance Targets:**

- Early upgrades feel impactful immediately
- Mid-game maintains engagement through variety
- Idle systems provide meaningful offline progress
- Training costs scale appropriately with EXP income

**Player Psychology:**

- Show concrete benefits (percentages, not vague descriptions)
- Anticipation through "Coming Soon" sections
- Achievement moments when unlocking new pages/systems
- Multiple upgrade paths for player choice

---

## Future Collaboration Areas

**Phase 3 (Backend + Cloud Saves):**

- Work with backy-boi to define progression validation rules
- What EXP gains are "impossible" in given timeframes?
- What level/stat combinations are invalid?
- Statistical ranges for legitimate vs suspicious progression

**Adventure System (Post-MVP):**

- Zone difficulty curves
- Loot drop rates and equipment progression
- Combat balance with stat requirements

## Recent Context (2025-10-31)

**v0.1.5 Game Rebalancing Complete:**

Full redesign session documented in `design/sessions/0.1.5-game-rebalancing.md`. Key systems:

**Stat Training System:**

- Stat EXP-based leveling: `100 × (1.5 ^ (statLevel - 1))` exp required
- Base 10 stat exp per training completion
- Training COSTS character EXP: `100 × (statLevel ^ 1.3)` character exp
- Creates trade-offs: spend exp on upgrades OR training

**Training/Meditation Split:**

- Physical stats (Str/Agi/Will/End): Training page (unlocks level 3)
- Mental stats (Int/Wis): Meditation page (unlocks with Tomes of Magic - later)
- Early game = 4 trainable stats

**Upgrade Philosophy:**

- Multi-level upgrades (25-100 levels each)
- Linear benefits per level (+1 exp/click, -0.5s training, etc.)
- Exponential costs (1.5x per level)
- Post-retreat scaling from KP multipliers

**Ruminate (Idle EXP):**

- Unlocks level 2
- Base: 10 exp/tick at 10s/tick
- Discipline (5x) makes it viable: 50 exp/tick baseline
- Max endgame: 600 exp/second before KP multipliers

**Character Level Unlocks:**

- Level 1: Practice (clicking)
- Level 2: Training page + Ruminate
- Level 3: RPG stat training
- Level 4: First retreat available
- Level 5: Stat click mode (click-to-complete-faster)

**Retreat System (Deferred):**

- Knowledge Points (KP) from Adventure Points
- Multiple prestige layers (KP, Wizard Points)
- Auto-buyers unlock after X retreats
