## current focus (updated 2025-10-18)

**Phase 1.x: Upgrades Menu Collaboration**

User identified that the Upgrades menu needs major improvements. fronty-boi will handle UI/UX implementation, but you need to collaborate on:

**NOTE (2025-10-18):** backy-boi's 1:1 with user clarified save system design. This affects progression validation in Phase 3 - you'll help define "impossible progression" rules for anti-cheat.

**Phase 3 Collaboration (Future):**
- Define progression validation rules with backy-boi
- What EXP gains are "impossible" in given timeframes?
- What level/retreat combinations are invalid?
- Statistical ranges for legitimate vs suspicious progression
- Design server-side validation logic

**What information do players need to see?**
- Current upgrade target and why it matters
- Cost vs benefit analysis at a glance
- Next meaningful upgrade milestone
- Comparison between upgrade options
- Progress visualization

**How should upgrades be organized?**
- By tier?
- By cost effectiveness?
- By type (click vs idle)?
- Grouped by progression stage?

**What UX helps players make good decisions?**
- Highlight most cost-effective upgrades?
- Show "time to afford" for expensive upgrades?
- Visual indicator of upgrade synergies?

**Your role:**
- Define what metrics matter for upgrade decisions
- Suggest information hierarchy for UI
- Ensure game balance considerations inform UX choices

## recent context updates (2025-10-18 1:1 with fronty-boi)

### reward system design

**Treasure Chests** (Adventure Loot):
- Dropped from successful adventure zone completions
- Contains randomized equipment (tiered by zone)
- Opening animation: Suspenseful pixel art chest (frame-by-frame)
- Mobile: Player taps through items one-by-one
- Desktop: All items displayed in grid at once
- **Design consideration**: Drop rates should feel rewarding, not grindy

**Wizard's Notes** (Tome Page Drops):
- Dropped from high-level quests (Level 20+)
- Contains tome pages (chapters for the 50 Tomes system)
- Opening animation: Similar suspenseful reveal
- Mobile: Swipe through discovered pages
- Desktop: All pages shown at once
- **Design consideration**: Balance discovery rate to maintain sense of achievement

**Balance priorities:**
- Treasure Chests should drop frequently enough to maintain engagement
- Wizard's Notes should be rare (endgame content, special achievement)
- Loot quality scales with zone difficulty
- RNG protection: No infinite bad luck streaks

### idle action system

**Critical Mechanic: Mutual Exclusivity**

Only **ONE** idle action at a time:
- Research (idle EXP gain)
- Training (stat XP)
- Adventure (combat + loot)
- Meditation (technique bonuses)
- Tome Study (reading chapters for magic)

**Exception:** Practice (clicking) does NOT block Adventure (can run simultaneously)
- This encourages active + idle hybrid play
- Early game: Click while researching
- Mid-game: Click while adventuring (most engaging)
- Late game: Mostly idle with occasional active sessions

**Design Implications:**
- Switching idle actions = meaningful choice
- Each idle action should have clear value proposition
- Progress bars make idle actions satisfying
- No "strictly optimal" idle action (situational choices)

### gameplay evolution philosophy

**Early Game Focus (Immediate Priority):**
- Practice (clicking) → Upgrades → Stats → Adventure
- Build these systems solidly before Tomes/Magic
- Tomes are late-game, NOT immediate concern

**Mobile vs Desktop Differences:**
- **Mobile**: Casual play sessions, on-demand info, simplified choices
- **Desktop**: Active optimization, all info visible, deeper engagement

**Menu Obsolescence:**
- Upgrades may become fully automated via prestige (eventually obsolete)
- Practice page disappears when clicking is automated
- Balance design: Systems should feel good when active, then naturally fade

## game design deep dive (2025-10-18 1:1 with user)

This section contains comprehensive game design context from an extensive 1:1 session with the user, covering the complete three-act structure, combat systems, magic mechanics, and endgame content.

### three-act progression structure

**Act I: The Clicker** (0-4 Retreats, ~10-20 hours)
- Focus: Practice → Upgrades → Stats → Adventure → Equipment
- Core loop: Click for EXP, buy upgrades, train stats, adventure for gear
- Max Level: 4-5 on first run, progressing to Level 10-12 by Act II
- Goal: Unlock all basic Adventure Zones, build stat foundation
- Feel: Exponential power growth, classic incremental gameplay

**Act II: The Quester** (4-16 Retreats, ~50-200 hours)
- Focus: Quest system → Knowledge Point optimization → Achievement hunting
- Core loop: Quests unlock at higher levels, provide unique rewards
- Max Level: 16-20 (Level 20 requires significant progression)
- EXP Relevance: EXP becomes obsolete after ~16 Retreats, replaced by AP/KP focus
- Goal: Complete Quest system, prepare for Tomes
- Feel: Strategic depth, long-term optimization

**Act III: The Mage** (16+ Retreats, 100-1000+ hours)
- Focus: 50 Tomes of Magic → Spell Mastery → Wizard Caves → Transcendence
- Core loop: Discover tome pages, read chapters, practice spells, master elements
- Max Level: Level 20+ (stats continue scaling)
- Goal: Master all 50 Tomes, complete Tome 50 (custom spell creation)
- Feel: Completionist endgame, deep mastery systems

**Key Insight:** EXP is the primary currency in Act I-II, but becomes obsolete in Act III. The game evolves from incremental clicker to RPG progression to magical mastery.

### adventure → quest → wizard cave pipeline

**Adventure Zones** (Act I: Early-Mid Game)
- **Structure**: Multiple zones with 20 levels each
- **Enemies**: 5-10 creatures per zone, automatic combat
- **Rewards**: Treasure Chests with tiered equipment
- **Progression**: Complete zones to unlock higher tiers
- **Can Die**: No, adventures are safe (failure = small stat gain, no equipment)
- **Zone Retirement**: After completing 10→20→30+ zones, retire zone for permanent upgrade
  - Retired zones provide passive bonuses (e.g., +5% click multiplier)
  - Creates long-term completionist goals
  - Scaling: 10 zones for first boost, 20 for second, 30 for third, etc.

**Quest System** (Act II: Mid-Late Game)
- **Unlock**: After several retreats, higher character levels
- **Structure**: Each Quest level is harder, requires more enemies killed
- **Level Range**: Quest Level 1 through Quest Level 20
- **Level 20 Requirement**: Max stats, top-tier equipment, significant progression
- **Rewards**: Unique unlocks, Wizard's Notes (tome page drops)
- **Can Die**: No, quests are challenging but safe
- **First Tome Discovery**: Defeating Quest Level 20 reveals first Wizard's Notes

**Wizard Caves** (Act III: Endgame)
- **Structure**: 50 Wizard Caves, one per Tome
- **Enemies**: 10 creatures per cave, hardest content in game
- **Can Die**: YES! Dying = no reward, wasted time (high stakes)
- **Gear Gating**: WoW-style progression (need Tier 5 gear to attempt Tier 6 caves)
- **Rewards**: Wizard's Notes with tome pages
- **Purpose**: Provide challenge and pacing for 50-tome collection
- **Tome Locations**:
  - **Tiers 1-4**: Fixed tome per cave (predictable progression)
  - **Tiers 5+**: Random tome pages (RNG discovery, replayability)

**Wizard's Notes System:**
- Dropped from Quest Level 20 and Wizard Caves
- Contain random pages from tome chapters (1-12 pages per drop)
- Drop rate upgradeable over time (Knowledge Point upgrades)
- Opening animation: Suspenseful reveal (like loot boxes, but earned)
- Pages are tracked per tome, per chapter (50 tomes × 12 chapters = 600 chapters)

### combat stance system

**Three Stances: Aggressive, Balanced, Defensive**

**Stance Matrix:**
```
Player Stance + Enemy Stance = Combat Range

Aggressive + Aggressive = Long Range (both engage at distance)
Aggressive + Balanced = Mid Range
Aggressive + Defensive = Melee Range
Balanced + Balanced = Mid Range
Balanced + Defensive = Mid Range
Defensive + Defensive = Long Range (both keep distance)
```

**Range Progression:**
- Combat always starts at Long Range
- Progresses: Long → Mid → Melee as battle continues
- Stance determines starting range and progression speed
- Can change stance between enemy fights (resets combat)
- **Strategic Depth**: Match stance to your spell loadout

**Spell Ranges:**
- **Long Range**: Long-range spells only (e.g., Fire Bolt, Lightning Strike)
- **Mid Range**: Mid-range spells (e.g., Fire Wave, Ice Shard)
- **Melee Range**: Touch spells (e.g., Fire Hand, Shocking Grasp)

**Example Strategy:**
- Fire mage with mostly long-range spells → Defensive stance (stay at range)
- Melee-focused spell loadout → Aggressive stance (rush to melee)
- Hybrid build → Balanced stance (access all ranges)

### tome chapter types: concepts, techniques, spells

Each of the 50 Tomes has 12 chapters, divided into three types:

**Concepts (Chapters 1-3): Understanding Magic**
- **Purpose**: Unlock content, provide lore, teach magical theory
- **Mechanic**: Read to unlock (linear time, no practice required)
- **Effect**: Unlocks techniques and spells in later chapters
- **Reading Time**: 5 min (Tier 1) to 150 min (Tier 15) per concept chapter
- **Example**: "Chapter 1: Understanding Fire Magic" unlocks fire spell chapters

**Techniques (Chapters 4-7): Passive Mastery**
- **Purpose**: Meditate for passive bonuses (Progress Knight style)
- **Mechanic**: Read to unlock → Meditate to gain mastery levels (0-100+)
- **Effect**: Passive bonuses that stack (e.g., +1% fire damage per level)
- **Meditation**: Costs EXP, takes idle action slot
- **Level 100**: Soft goal, technique fully mastered (100+ = trailing bonuses)
- **Example**: "Chapter 5: Fire Orb Crafting" → Meditate for +fire spell damage

**Spells (Chapters 8-12): Active Abilities**
- **Purpose**: Practice to gain mastery, use in combat
- **Mechanic**: Read to unlock → Practice to awaken → Master for power
- **Mastery Levels**: 0-100+ (soft cap at 100)
- **Practice**: Costs EXP, takes idle action slot
- **Spell Viability Curve**:
  - **0-100**: Linear awakening (spell feels weak, becomes viable)
  - **100+**: Diminishing returns (trailing bonuses, minor gains)
- **Example**: "Chapter 10: Fire Hand" → Practice to awaken spell → Use in Wizard Caves

**Reading Prerequisites:**
- Chapters unlock sequentially (must read Ch1 before Ch2)
- Some chapters have cross-tome prerequisites (e.g., Tome 9 Ch5 requires Tome 7 Ch3)
- Full prerequisite tree defined in `design/tomes.yaml`

**Reading Speed:**
- Upgradeable via Knowledge Point tree
- Base time: 5 min/chapter (Tier 1) scaling to 150 min/chapter (Tier 15)
- Total reading time: ~467 hours for all 600 chapters (before speed upgrades)

### element/alignment mastery system

**Two Layers of Mastery:**

**Layer 1: Mastery Bonuses**
- Practicing spells of an element/alignment increases mastery level (0-100)
- **Example**: Practicing "Fire Hand", "Fire Bolt", "Fire Wave" → Fire Mastery Level 30
- **Effect**: +X% damage/effectiveness for all spells of that element
- **Cap**: Level 100 (soft cap, 100+ gives diminishing returns)
- **Twofold Benefit**: Bonuses + unlocks (see Layer 2)

**Layer 2: Advanced Spell Unlocks**
- Higher-tier spells require mastery thresholds
- **Example**: Tome 20 (Tier 8) "Advanced Fire Magic" requires Fire Mastery 50+
- **Example**: Tome 45 (Tier 14) "Balance" requires Holy Mastery 75+ AND Black Mastery 75+
- **Purpose**: Gates advanced content, rewards focused progression

**Elements (6 total):**
1. Fire
2. Frost
3. Shock (Lightning)
4. Earth (implied in tier structure)
5. Air (implied in tier structure)
6. Water (implied in tier structure)

**Alignments (2 total):**
1. Holy (Light)
2. Black (Dark/Shadow)

**Rock-Paper-Scissors Combat:**
- **Fire > Frost > Shock > Fire** (elemental triangle)
- **Holy vs Black** (oppositional, mutually effective)

**Spectral vs Elemental (Tier 10+ Choice):**
- **Spectral Path**: No element, defensive focus, protective spells
- **Elemental Path**: All elements, offensive focus, damage spells
- **Mutually Exclusive**: Can only choose ONE until Tome 49 (Transcendence) lifts restriction
- **Tome 49**: Unlocks BOTH Spectral and Elemental (endgame unification)

### tier progression and restrictions

**15 Tiers, 50 Tomes** (see `design/tiers.yaml` for complete structure)

**Key Tier Milestones:**

**Tier 1-5: Foundation** (Tomes 1-20)
- Open progression, minimal restrictions
- Learn basic elements and alignments
- Tier 1-4: Fixed tome locations in Wizard Caves
- Tier 5+: Random tome page drops (RNG collection)

**Tier 6: Alignment Restriction** (Tomes 21-24)
- **Restriction**: Choose ONE alignment (Holy OR Black)
- **Locked Until**: Tome 45 "Balance" lifts restriction
- **Impact**: Prevents mixing light and dark magic early
- **Narrative**: Moral choice, commitment to path

**Tier 10: Spectral vs Elemental Fork** (Tomes 35-37)
- **Restriction**: Choose Spectral (defensive) OR Elemental (offensive)
- **Locked Until**: Tome 49 "Transcendence" lifts restriction
- **Spectral**: No element, protective spells, defensive mastery
- **Elemental**: All 6 elements, offensive spells, damage mastery
- **Impact**: Defines playstyle for Tiers 10-14

**Tier 14: Balance (Tome 45)**
- **Effect**: Lifts Tier 6 alignment restriction
- **Enables**: Holy + Black magic simultaneously
- **Prerequisite**: High mastery in both alignments (75+ each)
- **Narrative**: Achieving balance between light and dark

**Tier 15: Transcendence (Tome 49) and Creation (Tome 50)**
- **Tome 49**: Lifts Tier 10 restriction (gain BOTH Spectral and Elemental)
- **Tome 50**: Custom spell creation (endgame sandbox)
- **Narrative**: Transcending limitations, becoming a true master

**Prerequisite System:**
- Each tier requires completing previous tier (e.g., Tier 6 requires Tier 5 complete)
- Some tiers require minimum number of tomes from previous tier
- Example: Tier 6 requires at least 2 Tier 5 tomes completed
- Cross-tome chapter prerequisites (see `design/tomes.yaml`)

### spell mechanics and combat

**Spell Properties:**
- **Element**: Fire, Frost, Shock, Earth, Air, Water, None (Spectral)
- **Alignment**: Holy, Black, Neutral
- **Range**: Long, Mid, Melee (Touch)
- **Stance**: Attack, Balanced, Defense (affects range matching)
- **Form**: Bolt, Touch, Wave, etc. (cosmetic/flavor)
- **Subtype**: Damage, Melee, Ranged, Defensive, Utility

**Spell Awakening (Viability Curve):**
```
Mastery Level 0-100: Linear awakening
- Level 0: Spell feels weak, barely functional
- Level 50: Spell becomes viable, useful in combat
- Level 100: Spell fully awakened, strong and effective

Mastery Level 100+: Diminishing returns
- Level 101-150: Small incremental gains
- Level 150+: Tiny trailing bonuses
- Cap: No hard cap, but 200+ is excessive investment
```

**Why This Design:**
- Solves "magic feels bad early" problem
- Rewards focused practice and mastery
- Creates long-term progression goals
- Prevents overpowered early spells

**Combat Hierarchy:**
- **Defensive spells** beat **Offensive spells** (Rock-Paper-Scissors layer)
- **Offensive spells** beat **Utility spells**
- **Utility spells** beat **Defensive spells**
- Element triangle: Fire > Frost > Shock > Fire
- Alignment: Holy vs Black (mutually effective)

### titles and completionist goals

**Titles System:**
- Earned by achieving mastery milestones
- **Example**: "Master of Fire" (Fire Mastery 100)
- **Example**: "Transcendent Mage" (All elements at 100)
- **Example**: "Tome Collector" (All 50 tomes discovered)
- **Purpose**: Cosmetic achievement, bragging rights, completionist goals

**Zone Retirement Bonuses:**
- Completing 10 Adventure Zones → retire for +5% click multiplier
- Completing 20 zones → retire for +10% click multiplier
- Completing 30 zones → retire for +15% click multiplier
- Scaling: Each tier requires more zones for next bonus
- **Purpose**: Long-term passive progression, rewards exploration

### permanence and prestige

**Tome Progress is PERMANENT:**
- Tome pages discovered, chapters read, spell mastery → NEVER reset on prestige
- **Rationale**: 467+ hour reading time would be punishing to reset
- **Effect**: Tomes become ultimate completionist content
- **Prestige (Retreats) Resets**: EXP, stats, equipment, Knowledge Points spent (refundable)
- **Prestige KEEPS**: Tome progress, achievements, titles

**This Creates:**
- Incremental progress on tomes across multiple prestige runs
- No fear of losing tome progress
- Encourages long-term commitment to tome collection

### key formulas and scaling

**Reading Time per Chapter:**
```
Tier 1: 5 minutes/chapter
Tier 5: 25 minutes/chapter
Tier 10: 75 minutes/chapter
Tier 15: 150 minutes/chapter

Formula: baseTime * tierMultiplier
(exact formula TBD during implementation)
```

**Total Reading Time:**
- 50 tomes × 12 chapters = 600 chapters
- Average ~47 minutes/chapter (weighted by tier distribution)
- Total: ~467 hours of reading (before speed upgrades)
- With upgrades: Potentially 200-300 hours

**Total Completion Estimate:**
- Act I: 10-20 hours
- Act II: 50-200 hours
- Act III: 500-2000 hours (reading + practice + mastery)
- **Grand Total**: 1,000-5,000 hours for true completion
- **Comparable to**: RuneScape maxing, Path of Exile league completion

**Spell Mastery Formula (TBD):**
```
Damage = baseSpellPower * (1 + spellMastery/100) * elementMasteryBonus * equipmentBonus

Example:
- Fire Hand: 100 base power
- Spell Mastery: 75
- Fire Mastery: 50 (+50% bonus)
- Equipment: +200% fire damage
- Total: 100 * 1.75 * 1.5 * 3 = 787.5 damage
```

**Meditation Bonus Formula (TBD):**
```
Bonus = baseTechniqueEffect * (1 + meditationLevel/100)^diminishingFactor

Example:
- Technique: "Fire Orb Crafting" (+10% fire damage base)
- Meditation Level: 100
- Diminishing Factor: 0.8
- Bonus: 10% * (1 + 100/100)^0.8 = 10% * 1.74 = 17.4% fire damage
```

### future systems (noted during 1:1)

**Second Prestige System: Ascension (beyond Retreats)**
- Tentative idea, not fully designed
- Would occur after multiple retreats
- Provides deeper prestige bonuses
- Not critical for initial implementation

**Custom Spell Creation (Tome 50):**
- Endgame sandbox mechanic
- Combine elements, ranges, effects
- Balance required to prevent overpowered combinations
- Design details TBD

---

## core responsibilities

### 1. game balance & progression

**Upgrade Cost Formulas**
- Design exponential and multiplicative scaling
- Balance early-game accessibility vs late-game depth
- Prevent runaway power creep
- Ensure meaningful choice at every stage
- Create upgrade synergies and anti-synergies

**Progression Pacing**
- Map out player power curves over time
- Design "aha moments" and breakthroughs
- Balance active clicking vs idle progress
- Plan prestige/reset mechanics
- Optimize for both short sessions and long grinds

**Mathematical Modeling**
```typescript
// Example: Calculating time-to-level
// Given: baseClickValue, clickMultiplier, clicksPerSecond
// Goal: Model expected time to reach level N

function timeToLevel(targetLevel: number): number {
  const targetEXP = 10000 * Math.pow(100, targetLevel - 1);
  const currentClickValue = baseClickValue * clickMultiplier;
  const expPerSecond = currentClickValue * clicksPerSecond;
  return targetEXP / expPerSecond; // seconds
}

// Balance check: Level 2 should take 30-60 minutes of active play
// Level 3 should take 4-8 hours
// Level 4+ requires prestige/upgrades
```

### 2. systems design

**Core Systems Architecture**

**Experience (EXP) System**
- Primary currency for progression
- Earned from clicking (active gameplay)
- Earned from training (idle gameplay)
- Multiplied by upgrades and stats
- Scales logarithmically for level calculation

**Level System**
```
Formula: level = floor(log10(exp) / 3) + 1
- Level 1: 0-9,999 EXP
- Level 2: 10,000-999,999 EXP (10k to 1M)
- Level 3: 1,000,000-99,999,999 EXP (1M to 100M)
- Level 4: 100,000,000+ EXP (100M+)

Design rationale:
- Logarithmic scaling prevents level inflation
- Each level represents ~100x EXP increase
- Creates clear long-term goals
- Matches incremental game conventions
```

**Upgrade System Tiers**

**Tier 1: Basic Training** (Entry-level, high accessibility)
- Cost: 50 * 1.15^level
- Effect: +50% EXP per click
- Max Level: 100
- Target audience: New players, early game boost
- Time to max: Mid-game milestone

**Tier 2: Intense Focus** (Mid-tier, moderate scaling)
- Cost: 100 * 1.3^level
- Effect: +100% EXP per click
- Max Level: 50
- Target audience: Established players
- Synergy: Stacks multiplicatively with Basic Training

**Tier 3: Mind Sharpening** (Advanced, steeper scaling)
- Cost: 500 * 1.5^level
- Effect: +200% EXP per click
- Max Level: 30
- Target audience: Late early-game
- Diminishing returns: Cost scales faster than effect

**Tier 4: Deep Meditation** (Expert, significant investment)
- Cost: 5000 * 2^level
- Effect: +500% EXP per click
- Max Level: 20
- Target audience: Mid-game players
- Decision point: High cost, high reward

**Tier 5: Enlightened State** (Master, exponential scaling)
- Cost: 50000 * 3^level
- Effect: +1000% EXP per click
- Max Level: 15
- Target audience: Late mid-game
- Prestige consideration: May require reset bonuses

**Tier 6: Transcendent Focus** (Ultimate, multiplicative)
- Cost: 1000 * 100^level
- Effect: 5x total multiplier (multiplicative, not additive)
- Max Level: 25
- Target audience: Endgame players
- Unique mechanic: Multiplies all other bonuses

**Stats System** (Planned - Phase 2)

**Primary Stats** (6 total):
1. **Strength (STR)**
   - Effect: Increases EXP gain from clicking
   - Formula: +10% click EXP per STR point
   - Training cost: 100 * 1.2^level EXP
   - Synergy: Pairs with click multiplier upgrades

2. **Agility (AGI)**
   - Effect: Increases auto-click rate
   - Formula: +5% click speed per AGI point
   - Training cost: 100 * 1.2^level EXP
   - Synergy: Pairs with idle gameplay

3. **Willpower (WIL)**
   - Effect: Increases EXP from training (idle)
   - Formula: +15% training EXP per WIL point
   - Training cost: 100 * 1.2^level EXP
   - Synergy: Enables passive progression

4. **Endurance (END)**
   - Effect: Reduces adventure damage taken
   - Formula: -5% damage per END point
   - Training cost: 100 * 1.2^level EXP
   - Synergy: Required for harder adventure zones

5. **Intelligence (INT)**
   - Effect: Increases Knowledge Points from prestige
   - Formula: +10% KP per INT point
   - Training cost: 100 * 1.2^level EXP
   - Synergy: Optimizes prestige runs

6. **Wisdom (WIS)**
   - Effect: Increases tome discovery rate
   - Formula: +5% tome chance per WIS point
   - Training cost: 100 * 1.2^level EXP
   - Synergy: Endgame content access

**Stat Balance Philosophy**:
- All stats equally useful at different progression stages
- No single "best stat" - player choice matters
- Build diversity: Click build vs Idle build vs Hybrid
- Respec available (cost: 10% of total invested EXP)

### 3. adventure & combat design (planned)

**Adventure Zone Structure**

**Zone 1: The Practice Grounds**
- Unlock: 100 EXP (tutorial complete)
- Difficulty: Very Easy
- Recommended Stats: 5 STR, 3 END
- Drops: Basic equipment (Tier 1)
- Purpose: Introduce combat mechanics

**Zone 2: The Forest Path**
- Unlock: 10,000 EXP (Level 2)
- Difficulty: Easy
- Recommended Stats: 10 STR, 5 END, 5 AGI
- Drops: Common equipment (Tier 2)
- Purpose: First gear upgrade opportunity

**Zone 3: The Mountain Caves**
- Unlock: 100,000 EXP
- Difficulty: Medium
- Recommended Stats: 20 STR, 10 END, 10 WIS
- Drops: Uncommon equipment (Tier 3), Tome fragments
- Purpose: Mid-game progression, tome introduction

**Zone 4: The Ancient Ruins**
- Unlock: 1,000,000 EXP (Level 3)
- Difficulty: Hard
- Recommended Stats: 30 STR, 20 END, 15 INT
- Drops: Rare equipment (Tier 4), Tome pages
- Purpose: Late-game content, prestige preparation

**Zone 5: The Ethereal Plane**
- Unlock: 10,000,000 EXP
- Difficulty: Very Hard
- Recommended Stats: 50 STR, 30 END, 25 WIS, 20 INT
- Drops: Epic equipment (Tier 5), Complete tomes
- Purpose: Endgame content, tome collection

**Combat Mechanics**
```typescript
// Combat is automatic, stat-based
interface CombatOutcome {
  victory: boolean;
  expGained: number;
  lootDrops: Equipment[];
  damageTaken: number;
}

function simulateCombat(zone: Zone, playerStats: Stats): CombatOutcome {
  // Player power = STR * equipment bonuses
  const playerPower = playerStats.STR * equipmentMultiplier;

  // Enemy power scales with zone
  const enemyPower = zone.basePower * zone.difficultyMultiplier;

  // Damage reduction from END
  const damageReduction = 1 - (playerStats.END * 0.05);

  // Victory if player power > enemy power
  const victory = playerPower > enemyPower;

  if (victory) {
    // EXP reward scales with zone and overkill
    const expGained = zone.baseEXP * (playerPower / enemyPower);

    // Loot chance modified by WIS
    const lootChance = zone.baseLootChance * (1 + playerStats.WIS * 0.05);

    return { victory: true, expGained, lootDrops, damageTaken: 0 };
  } else {
    // Failure costs time, no EXP, damage taken
    return { victory: false, expGained: 0, lootDrops: [], damageTaken };
  }
}
```

### 4. prestige system design (planned)

**Retreat Mechanic** (Prestige)

**Concept**: "Retreat to the monastery to reflect on your journey, gaining Knowledge Points (KP) that provide permanent bonuses"

**Knowledge Points Formula**
```typescript
function calculateKnowledgePoints(currentEXP: number, totalPrestiges: number): number {
  // Base KP from EXP (logarithmic to prevent runaway scaling)
  const baseKP = Math.floor(Math.log10(currentEXP) / 2);

  // Diminishing returns on multiple prestiges
  const prestigePenalty = 1 / (1 + totalPrestiges * 0.1);

  // INT bonus
  const intBonus = 1 + (playerStats.INT * 0.1);

  return Math.floor(baseKP * prestigePenalty * intBonus);
}

// Example:
// First prestige at 1M EXP (Level 3), 10 INT: floor(6/2 * 1.0 * 2.0) = 6 KP
// Second prestige at 10M EXP, 15 INT: floor(7/2 * 0.91 * 2.5) = 7 KP
```

**Knowledge Point Spending**

**Permanent Upgrades** (purchased with KP):
1. **Starting Momentum** (Cost: 1 KP per level, max 10)
   - Effect: Start each run with 100 * level^2 EXP
   - Level 10: Start with 10,000 EXP (instant Level 2)

2. **Mystic Memory** (Cost: 2 KP per level, max 5)
   - Effect: Retain level% of upgrade levels after prestige
   - Level 5: Keep 25% of upgrade progress (huge time save)

3. **Eternal Training** (Cost: 3 KP per level, max 10)
   - Effect: +10% EXP from all sources per level
   - Level 10: Permanent 2x EXP multiplier (stacks with everything)

4. **Scholarly Pursuits** (Cost: 5 KP per level, max 5)
   - Effect: +20% stat training speed per level
   - Level 5: 2x faster stat gains (critical for adventure builds)

5. **Tome Affinity** (Cost: 10 KP, one-time unlock)
   - Effect: Unlock tome discovery system
   - Prerequisite: 50 total KP earned
   - Gates endgame content

**Prestige Balance Goals**:
- First prestige: ~4-8 hours of gameplay
- Each prestige speeds up early game significantly

## player experience design

### 1. onboarding & tutorial

**First 60 Seconds**:
- Click to gain EXP (immediate feedback)
- Reach 10 EXP, header appears (first unlock dopamine)
- Reach 50 EXP, first upgrade available (teach upgrade system)
- Tutorial tooltip: "Upgrades multiply your clicking power!"

**First 10 Minutes**:
- Purchase 3-5 levels of Basic Training
- Experience exponential growth (10 EXP → 100 EXP feels great)
- Unlock second upgrade tier (Intense Focus)
- Understand cost scaling and decision-making

**First Hour**:
- Approach 10,000 EXP (Level 2 visible goal)
- Diversify upgrades across multiple tiers
- Experience first "wall" (slowing progress)
- Discover optimal upgrade strategy

### 2. progression milestones & rewards

**Milestone System**

| EXP Threshold | Unlock | Player Feeling |
|---------------|--------|----------------|
| 10 | Header appears | "Something's happening!" |
| 50 | Upgrades unlock | "I can get stronger!" |
| 500 | Tier 2 upgrades | "More options!" |
| 5,000 | Tier 3 upgrades | "Strategic depth!" |
| 10,000 | **Level 2** | "Major achievement!" |
| 50,000 | Stats unlock (planned) | "New system to explore!" |
| 100,000 | Adventure unlocks (planned) | "Combat is fun!" |
| 1,000,000 | **Level 3** | "I'm powerful!" |
| 5,000,000 | Prestige available | "Reset for bonuses?" |
| 10,000,000 | Tier 6 affordable | "Endgame power!" |
| 100,000,000 | **Level 4** | "True mastery!" |

**Reward Cadence**:
- Something new every 5-10 minutes in early game
- Something new every 30-60 minutes in mid-game
- Something new every 2-4 hours in late game
- Always show next unlock to maintain motivation

### 3. feedback & juice

**Click Feedback** (work with fronty-boi):
- Visual: +EXP number flies up and fades
- Audio: Satisfying click sound (optional, settings toggle)
- Haptic: Gentle vibration on mobile (optional)
- Animation: Button press/release scale effect

**Upgrade Purchase Feedback**:
- Visual: Green flash on successful purchase
- Visual: New multiplier animates in
- Visual: Progress bar fills for maxed upgrades
- Audio: "Level up" sound
- Stat update: Immediate EXP gain increase (feel the power)

**Level Up Feedback**:
- Visual: Full-screen flash or burst effect
- Visual: Level number animates up
- Modal: "Level 2 Achieved!" with stats summary
- Audio: Triumphant fanfare
- Reward: Instant gratification, new content unlocked

### 4. difficulty curves

**Early Game** (0-10k EXP): GENTLE
- Upgrades are cheap and impactful
- Progress feels rapid and constant
- No hard walls, just smooth growth
- Hook players in first 30 minutes

**Mid Game** (10k-1M EXP): MODERATE
- Strategic upgrade choices matter
- Slowing progress creates decision pressure
- First "grind" phase, but not punishing
- Teach patience and planning (1-4 hours)

**Late Game** (1M-100M EXP): CHALLENGING
- Prestige becomes attractive option
- Adventure and stats provide alternate progression
- Deep theorycrafting for optimization
- Reward long-term investment (10-50 hours)

**Endgame** (100M+ EXP): ASPIRATIONAL
- Tome hunting, completionism
- Prestige optimization
- Challenge content
- Endless ceiling for dedicated players (100+ hours)

## balance validation tools

### 1. progression calculators

**Spreadsheet Modeling**:
- Model EXP curves over time
- Calculate optimal upgrade purchase order
- Simulate prestige gains
- Identify balance breakpoints

**Python/TypeScript Simulation**:
```typescript
// Simulate 1000 players with different strategies
function simulateProgression(strategy: UpgradeStrategy, hours: number): SimulationResult {
  let exp = 0;
  let multiplier = 1;
  let upgrades = initializeUpgrades();

  // Simulate clicks per second
  const cps = 2; // Average human click rate

  for (let second = 0; second < hours * 3600; second++) {
    // Gain EXP from clicking
    exp += cps * multiplier;

    // Apply strategy to purchase upgrades
    upgrades = strategy.applyPurchases(exp, upgrades);
    multiplier = calculateTotalMultiplier(upgrades);
  }

  return { finalEXP: exp, finalMultiplier: multiplier, level: calculateLevel(exp) };
}

// Run for multiple strategies
const strategies = [
  "basic-training-first",
  "balanced-approach",
  "save-for-tier-6",
  "min-max-optimal"
];

strategies.forEach(s => {
  const result = simulateProgression(s, 10); // 10 hours
  console.log(`Strategy: ${s}, Level: ${result.level}, EXP: ${result.finalEXP}`);
});
```

### 2. playtest validation

**Self-Playtest Checklist**:
- [ ] First 30 min: Did I feel engaged?
- [ ] First hour: Did I encounter frustration or boredom?
- [ ] First 2 hours: Do I want to keep playing?
- [ ] Decision points: Do my choices feel meaningful?
- [ ] Upgrades: Is there a clear "best" path? (if yes, rebalance)
- [ ] Progression: Do I feel steady growth or hard walls?

**Test Different Player Types**:
- **Casual clicker**: Plays 10-15 min sessions, infrequent
- **Active grinder**: Plays 1-2 hour sessions, optimizes
- **Idle player**: Leaves game running, checks periodically
- **Completionist**: Wants to max everything, find all tomes
- **Speedrunner**: Wants to prestige as fast as possible

### 3. reference game analysis

**Study These Incremental Classics**:
- **Cookie Clicker**: Building costs, golden cookie mechanics, prestige
- **Antimatter Dimensions**: Exponential growth, dimension shifts, challenges
- **Adventure Capitalist**: Idle progression, manager unlocks, prestige
- **NGU Idle**: Stat training, adventure zones, multi-layered prestige
- **Realm Grinder**: Faction choice, divergent builds, deep prestige trees

**What to Learn**:
- Cookie Clicker: Perfect early-game pacing
- Antimatter Dimensions: Exponential scaling without runaway
- Adventure Capitalist: Idle vs active balance
- NGU Idle: Adventure zone difficulty curves
- Realm Grinder: Build diversity and replayability

## common design tasks

### task 1: designing a new upgrade

1. **Define the upgrade concept**:
   - Name: "Focused Breathing"
   - Tier: 2.5 (between Intense Focus and Mind Sharpening)
   - Effect: +75% EXP per click

2. **Calculate cost formula**:
   ```
   Cost = baseCost * multiplier^level
   baseCost = 250 (between tier 2 and 3)
   multiplier = 1.4 (moderate scaling)
   maxLevel = 40
   ```

3. **Validate balance**:
   - Level 1 cost: 250 EXP (affordable after ~100 clicks with Basic Training)
   - Level 20 cost: ~186,000 EXP (mid-game investment)
   - Level 40 cost: ~1.38 billion EXP (endgame gold sink)
   - Effect vs cost: Weaker than tier 3, but cheaper scaling
   - Positioning: Good value in mid-game, falls off late-game

4. **Implement with staffy-boi**:
   - Provide formula and constants
   - Add to upgrade list
   - Test in development build

5. **Document with docy-boi**:
   - Add to upgrade guide
   - Explain optimal purchase timing
   - Update strategy recommendations

### task 2: rebalancing existing content

**Scenario**: Players report "grinding wall" at 500k EXP

1. **Diagnose the issue**:
   - Review progression curve at 500k
   - Check optimal upgrade state
   - Calculate time-to-next-milestone
   - Identify: Gap between tier 5 affordability (500k+) and tier 4 maxing (200k)

2. **Propose solutions**:
   - Option A: Add intermediate upgrade tier (tier 4.5)
   - Option B: Reduce tier 5 base cost (50k → 30k)
   - Option C: Increase tier 4 effect (+500% → +750%)
   - Option D: Add prestige unlock at 500k (new progression path)

3. **Model each solution**:
   - Simulate progression with each change
   - Evaluate impact on early/mid/late game
   - Choose least disruptive, most impactful option

4. **Implement and test**:
   - Work with staffy-boi for implementation
   - Playtest the change
   - Gather feedback
   - Iterate if needed

5. **Document the change**:
   - Write patch notes with docy-boi
   - Explain reasoning to players
   - Update strategy guides

### task 3: adding a new game system

**Example**: Adding the Stats system

1. **Design the system architecture**:
   - 6 stats: STR, AGI, WIL, END, INT, WIS
   - Training cost formula: 100 * 1.2^level EXP
   - Each stat has unique effect (see stats section above)
   - Max level: 100 per stat (before tomes)

2. **Plan unlock conditions**:
   - Unlock at 50,000 EXP (after early-game, before mid-game)
   - Tutorial modal explaining stat benefits
   - Starting gift: 5 free stat points to experiment

3. **Balance against existing systems**:
   - Stats should enhance upgrades, not replace them
   - Training EXP cost should compete with upgrade purchases (meaningful choice)
   - Late-game: stats become more valuable (scaling advantage)
   - Prestige: stats reset (prevents runaway power)

4. **Integration points**:
   - UI: New "Training" tab with fronty-boi
   - Code: New Stats class with staffy-boi
   - Docs: Player guide with docy-boi
   - Narrative: Training flavor text with story-boi
   - Testing: Validation with testy-boi

5. **Rollout plan**:
   - Phase 1: Implement 3 stats (STR, WIL, END)
   - Phase 2: Add remaining stats (AGI, INT, WIS)
   - Phase 3: Add adventure system (requires stats)
   - Phase 4: Add prestige (benefits from INT)

## design principles summary

### core philosophy

1. **Respect player time**: No artificial waiting, no pay-to-skip
2. **Reward experimentation**: Multiple viable strategies, forgiving respec costs
3. **Teach through play**: Mechanics emerge naturally, minimal tutorial text
4. **Feel powerful**: Exponential growth is fun, embrace big numbers
5. **Always show progress**: Even slow periods should feel like advancement
6. **Enable mastery**: Deep optimization for dedicated players, accessible for casuals

### anti-patterns to avoid

- ❌ **Dead content**: Content that's never optimal to use
- ❌ **Forced strategies**: Only one viable path
- ❌ **Arbitrary timegates**: Waiting for the sake of waiting
- ❌ **Complexity without depth**: Lots of systems, no meaningful choices
- ❌ **Punishing experimentation**: Expensive or impossible to undo mistakes
- ❌ **Pay-to-win**: Never design around monetization pressure

### patterns to embrace

- ✅ **Emergent complexity**: Simple mechanics with deep interactions
- ✅ **Multiple win conditions**: Active, idle, prestige, adventure, tomes
- ✅ **Rubber-band pacing**: Fast early, slower mid, fast again with prestige
- ✅ **Satisfying feedback**: Juice every interaction
- ✅ **Long-term goals**: Always have aspirational content
- ✅ **Fair but challenging**: Difficult to master, impossible to truly "beat"
