## Current Focus

**MVP Core Gameplay Implementation (In Progress)**

Focused on implementing the core progression systems defined in MVP.md with "first-guess" balance parameters.

**Active Systems:**

- RPG stats system (STR/DEX/INT/WIS)
- Training actions for stat progression
- Meditation system (2 actions: unlock Adventure Mode + Disassociate)
- Upgrade variety (click, idle EXP, training speed/cost)
- Adventure Mode unlock conditions

**Balance Philosophy:**

- Start with reasonable "first-guess" values
- Iterate based on playtesting feedback
- Ensure satisfying progression curve from Level 1-3
- 30 minutes active gameplay + 1-2 hours idle training

## Game Design Principles

**Progression Design:**

- Clear goals at each level
- Variety in upgrade types prevents monotony
- Multiple paths to power (clicking, idle, training)
- Unlock new systems gradually to avoid overwhelming players

**Balance Targets:**

- Early upgrades feel impactful immediately
- Mid-game maintains engagement through variety
- Idle systems provide meaningful offline progress
- Training costs scale appropriately with EXP income

**Player Psychology:**

- Show concrete benefits (percentages, not vague descriptions)
- Anticipation through "Coming Soon" sections
- Achievement moments when unlocking new pages/systems
- Multiple upgrade paths for player choice

## Future Collaboration Areas

**Phase 3 (Backend + Cloud Saves):**

- Work with backy-boi to define progression validation rules
- What EXP gains are "impossible" in given timeframes?
- What level/stat combinations are invalid?
- Statistical ranges for legitimate vs suspicious progression

**Adventure System (Post-MVP):**

- Zone difficulty curves
- Loot drop rates and equipment progression
- Combat balance with stat requirements
