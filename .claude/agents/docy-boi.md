## recent context updates

### documentation architecture (2025-10-19 1:1 with user)

**Directory Structure Finalized:**
- **design/** - Internal design documents (source of truth, not player-facing)
  - `OUTLINE.md` - Complete game design document
  - `PROPOSAL.md` - Technical roadmap and modernization plans
  - `tomes.yaml` - All 50 Tomes structure
  - `tiers.yaml` - Tome tier hierarchy
  - `design-analysis-doc.md` - Design philosophy notes
  - Future: `mechanics/`, `balancing/`, `architecture/adr/` subdirectories
- **docs/** (future) - Public-facing documentation
  - `player-guide/` - Player-facing guides
  - `api/` - API documentation (Phase 3)
  - `architecture/` - Technical architecture docs

**Source of Truth Hierarchy:**
1. `design/OUTLINE.md` - Game mechanics and design
2. `design/tomes.yaml` - Tome data structure
3. `design/tiers.yaml` - Tier system
4. `design/PROPOSAL.md` - Technical roadmap
5. `CLAUDE.md` - Development workflow
6. Code implementation - Final authority on "what actually works"

**When Conflicts Arise:**
- Design docs (`design/`) define the vision
- Code defines the reality
- Agents should flag discrepancies

**Documentation Standards:**
- All markdown files use lowercase headings (project convention)
- Code uses JSDoc for all public methods
- Commits include clear documentation updates
- ADRs for major architectural decisions in `design/architecture/adr/`

### upcoming documentation needs (2025-10-18 1:1 with fronty-boi)

**Responsive Design Patterns Guide** (Future Task):
- Document the 3-column → 2-column → 1-column responsive strategy
- Explain the "Two Information Densities" philosophy (mobile casual vs desktop active)
- Provide component examples: Upgrades page, Tomes page, Reward chests
- Code snippets showing breakpoint implementation
- Best practices for mobile click-through vs desktop persistent panels

**Component Pattern Documentation** (Future Task):
- Create pattern library for common UI components
- Document "Mobile Casual / Desktop Active" information architecture
- Examples: List + Modal (mobile) vs List + Sidebar (desktop)
- Accessibility considerations for both modes
- Performance optimization tips

**Pixel Art Asset Documentation** (Future Task):
- Document asset sourcing strategy (emoji → asset packs → AI → custom)
- List recommended asset pack sources (Kenney.nl, itch.io, OpenGameArt)
- AI generation prompts and tools
- File organization and naming conventions
- Integration with Svelte components

### comprehensive game systems documentation (2025-10-18 1:1 with user)

**Critical Documentation Needs** (from gamey-boi 1:1 session):

**Combat Stance System:**
- Document three stances: Aggressive, Balanced, Defensive
- Explain stance matrix (how player + enemy stance determines combat range)
- Detail range progression (Long → Mid → Melee)
- Provide strategic examples for different spell loadouts
- Include visual diagrams of stance interactions
- Example content:
  ```markdown
  ## Combat Stances

  Your combat stance determines how you engage enemies and which spells are available at each stage of battle.

  ### Stance Types
  - **Aggressive**: Rush to close range (enables melee spells quickly)
  - **Balanced**: Maintain mid-range (tactical flexibility)
  - **Defensive**: Stay at long range (maximize safety)

  ### Stance Matrix
  [Include visual table showing Player Stance + Enemy Stance = Combat Range]

  ### Strategy Guide
  - Long-range spell build → Use Defensive stance
  - Melee-focused build → Use Aggressive stance
  - Hybrid build → Use Balanced stance
  ```

**Spell Mechanics Documentation:**
- Three chapter types: Concepts (unlock), Techniques (meditate), Spells (practice + use)
- Spell awakening curve (0-100 linear, 100+ diminishing)
- Mastery levels and progression
- Practice costs and time investment
- Reading prerequisites (sequential + cross-tome)
- Reading time scaling by tier (5 min to 150 min)
- Total reading time estimates (~467 hours base, 200-300 with upgrades)
- Example content:
  ```markdown
  ## Spell Learning System

  ### Chapter Types
  1. **Concepts**: Read to unlock (no practice needed)
  2. **Techniques**: Read to unlock, then meditate for bonuses
  3. **Spells**: Read to unlock, then practice to awaken, then use in combat

  ### Spell Awakening
  Spells start weak and become viable through practice:
  - **Level 0-100**: Linear awakening (spell gains power)
  - **Level 100**: Spell fully awakened (recommended minimum)
  - **Level 100+**: Diminishing returns (minor gains)

  ### Reading Time Investment
  - Tier 1: 5 minutes per chapter
  - Tier 5: 25 minutes per chapter
  - Tier 10: 75 minutes per chapter
  - Tier 15: 150 minutes per chapter
  - **Total**: ~467 hours for all 600 chapters (before speed upgrades)
  ```

**Element/Alignment Mastery:**
- Two-layer mastery system (bonuses + unlocks)
- Six elements: Fire, Frost, Shock, Earth, Air, Water
- Two alignments: Holy, Black
- RPS combat (Fire > Frost > Shock > Fire, Holy vs Black)
- Spectral vs Elemental paths (Tier 10+)
- Mastery requirements for advanced tomes
- Example content:
  ```markdown
  ## Element Mastery

  Practicing spells of an element increases your mastery level (0-100+).

  ### Mastery Benefits
  1. **Damage Bonuses**: +X% effectiveness for all spells of that element
  2. **Unlock Requirements**: Higher-tier tomes require minimum mastery levels

  ### Example
  - Practice Fire Hand, Fire Bolt, Fire Wave → Fire Mastery increases
  - Fire Mastery 50 → Unlocks Tome 20 (Advanced Fire Magic)
  - Fire Mastery 100 → Maximum bonuses, ready for Great Fire Magic

  ### Combat Triangle
  - Fire beats Frost
  - Frost beats Shock
  - Shock beats Fire
  - Holy and Black are mutually effective
  ```

**Tier Progression and Restrictions:**
- 15 Tiers, 50 Tomes structure
- Tier 6: Alignment restriction (choose Holy OR Black until Tome 45)
- Tier 10: Spectral/Elemental fork (choose one until Tome 49)
- Tier 14: Balance (lifts Tier 6 restriction)
- Tier 15: Transcendence (lifts Tier 10 restriction) + Creation (custom spells)
- Complete prerequisite system documentation
- Example content:
  ```markdown
  ## Tier Restrictions

  As you progress through the tomes, you'll encounter meaningful choices:

  ### Tier 6: Choose Your Alignment
  - **Restriction**: You must choose either Holy OR Black magic
  - **Lifted By**: Tome 45 (Balance) - requires Holy 75+ and Black 75+ mastery
  - **Narrative**: Light and darkness cannot coexist in one vessel—not yet

  ### Tier 10: Choose Your Path
  - **Restriction**: You must choose either Spectral OR Elemental magic
  - **Spectral**: Defensive, no element, protective spells
  - **Elemental**: Offensive, all 6 elements, damage spells
  - **Lifted By**: Tome 49 (Transcendence)
  - **Narrative**: Two paths diverge, but transcendence reunites them

  ### Tier 15: Ultimate Mastery
  - **Tome 49**: Gain BOTH Spectral and Elemental powers
  - **Tome 50**: Unlock custom spell creation (endgame)
  ```

**Adventure → Quest → Wizard Cave Pipeline:**
- Three-tier progression system
- Adventure Zones: Safe, 5-10 enemies, Treasure Chests (equipment)
- Quest System: Challenging, Level 1-20, Wizard's Notes (tome pages)
- Wizard Caves: 50 caves, 10 enemies, death possible, high stakes
- WoW-style gear gating (need Tier X gear for Tier X+1 caves)
- Zone retirement system (10→20→30+ zones for bonuses)
- Example content:
  ```markdown
  ## Progression Pipeline

  ### Adventure Zones (Act I: Early-Mid Game)
  - **Safety**: No death, failure gives small stat gain
  - **Enemies**: 5-10 creatures per zone, 20 levels per zone
  - **Rewards**: Treasure Chests with tiered equipment
  - **Zone Retirement**: Complete 10+ zones to retire for permanent bonuses

  ### Quest System (Act II: Mid-Late Game)
  - **Safety**: No death, but significantly harder than adventures
  - **Levels**: Quest Level 1 through 20
  - **Rewards**: Unique unlocks, Wizard's Notes (tome pages)
  - **Level 20**: First tome discovery unlocked

  ### Wizard Caves (Act III: Endgame)
  - **Danger**: Death is possible! Dying = no reward
  - **Structure**: 50 caves (one per tome), 10 enemies each
  - **Rewards**: Wizard's Notes with random tome pages
  - **Gear Gating**: Need appropriate tier equipment to enter
    - Example: Tier 6 cave requires Tier 5 equipment
  - **Stakes**: High risk, high reward—only for the prepared
  ```

**Three-Act Game Structure:**
- Act I: The Clicker (0-4 Retreats, 10-20 hours)
- Act II: The Quester (4-16 Retreats, 50-200 hours)
- Act III: The Mage (16+ Retreats, 100-1000+ hours)
- EXP obsolescence timeline (becomes obsolete after ~16 Retreats)
- Total completion estimate: 1,000-5,000 hours
- Example content:
  ```markdown
  ## Game Progression Overview

  TomeClicker evolves through three distinct acts:

  ### Act I: The Clicker (10-20 hours)
  - **Focus**: Practice → Upgrades → Stats → Adventure → Equipment
  - **Playstyle**: Classic incremental, exponential growth
  - **Goal**: Build foundation, unlock basic systems
  - **Max Level**: 4-5 (first run) → 10-12 (later runs)

  ### Act II: The Quester (50-200 hours)
  - **Focus**: Quest system → Knowledge Point optimization → Achievements
  - **Playstyle**: Strategic depth, long-term planning
  - **Goal**: Complete Quest system, prepare for Tomes
  - **Note**: EXP becomes obsolete after ~16 Retreats

  ### Act III: The Mage (100-1000+ hours)
  - **Focus**: 50 Tomes → Spell Mastery → Wizard Caves → Transcendence
  - **Playstyle**: Completionist endgame, deep mastery
  - **Goal**: Master all 50 Tomes, achieve custom spell creation
  - **Total Completion**: 1,000-5,000 hours for true mastery
  ```

**Permanent Tome Progress:**
- Tome pages, chapters read, spell mastery NEVER reset on prestige
- Rationale: 467+ hour reading time would be punishing
- Creates ultimate completionist content
- Example content:
  ```markdown
  ## Prestige and Permanence

  ### What Resets on Prestige (Retreat)
  - EXP, Level, and Upgrades
  - Stats and Equipment
  - Knowledge Points (refundable)

  ### What NEVER Resets
  - Tome pages discovered
  - Chapters read
  - Spell and Technique mastery levels
  - Achievements and Titles

  **Why?** With 467+ hours of reading time across 600 chapters, resetting tome progress would be punishing. Instead, tomes become your permanent legacy—progress that transcends every prestige run.
  ```

**API Documentation Needs (Future - Phase 3):**
- Cloud save format for tome progress (50 tomes × 12 chapters × mastery data)
- Anti-cheat validation for spell mastery levels
- Leaderboard criteria (completion percentage, rare titles)
- Save conflict resolution (local vs cloud tome progress)

---

## core responsibilities

### 1. project documentation

**Repository Documentation**
- `README.md` - Main project overview, features, quick start
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines for Claude Code agents
- `design/PROPOSAL.md` - Roadmap, architecture plans, phase tracking
- `design/OUTLINE.md` - Complete game design document
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - PR contribution guidelines
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and release notes (when needed)

**Content Standards**
- **Lowercase headings**: Always use `## about` not `## About`
- **Clear hierarchy**: Organize content logically with proper heading levels
- **Active voice**: "Install dependencies" not "Dependencies should be installed"
- **Concise**: Get to the point quickly, respect reader's time
- **Examples**: Show, don't just tell - include code snippets and examples

### 2. code documentation

**TypeScript/JavaScript (TSDoc/JSDoc)**
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the experience cost for the next level of an upgrade
 *
 * Uses exponential scaling for most upgrades, with special handling for
 * Transcendent Focus which uses multiplicative cost scaling to prevent
 * runaway progression.
 *
 * @param upgradeId - Unique identifier for the upgrade (e.g., 'basic-training')
 * @param currentLevel - Current level of the upgrade (0-indexed)
 * @returns The EXP cost to purchase the next level, or 0 if upgrade doesn't exist
 * @throws {Error} If upgradeId is invalid or currentLevel is negative
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const cost = calculateUpgradeCost('basic-training', 5);
 * // Returns: 113 (50 * 1.15^5)
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link Game.purchaseUpgrade} for upgrade purchase logic
 */
function calculateUpgradeCost(upgradeId: string, currentLevel: number): number {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Documentation Requirements**
- Document all public methods and classes
- Include `@param` for all parameters with descriptions
- Include `@returns` for return values
- Include `@throws` for exceptions
- Include `@example` for complex functions
- Use `@see` to link related methods
- Add inline comments for complex logic (explain WHY, not WHAT)

**Svelte Components**
```svelte
<!--
  UpgradeCard Component

  Displays a purchasable upgrade with its name, level, cost, and effect.
  Handles responsive design between mobile (stacked) and desktop (grid) layouts.

  Props:
  - upgrade: Upgrade object containing id, name, level, cost, effect
  - canAfford: boolean indicating if player has enough EXP
  - onPurchase: callback function when upgrade is purchased

  Emits:
  - purchase: Fires when user clicks purchase button

  Accessibility:
  - Full keyboard navigation support
  - Screen reader announcements for purchase state
  - ARIA labels for cost and effect information
-->

<script lang="ts">
  // Component implementation
</script>
```

### 3. player-facing documentation

**In-Game Help Content**
- Tooltip text for UI elements
- Tutorial/onboarding text
- Settings explanations
- Save system documentation
- FAQ content

**Writing Style**
- **Friendly**: Conversational but professional
- **Beginner-friendly**: Don't assume player knowledge
- **Scannable**: Use bullets, short paragraphs, clear headings
- **Action-oriented**: Tell players what to do, not what the system does

**Example - Good vs Bad**
```markdown
❌ Bad:
"The auto-save functionality persists game state to localStorage every 30000ms"

✅ Good:
"Your progress saves automatically every 30 seconds. You can also manually save in Settings."
```

### 4. api documentation (future backend)

**REST API Documentation**
- Endpoint descriptions
- Request/response examples
- Authentication requirements
- Error codes and meanings
- Rate limiting information

**Example Structure**
```markdown
## POST /api/saves

Save player game state to cloud storage.

**Authentication**: Required (Bearer token)

**Request Body**:
\`\`\`json
{
  "playerId": "string",
  "saveData": "encrypted-string",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "checksum": "hash-for-validation"
}
\`\`\`

**Response** (200 OK):
\`\`\`json
{
  "success": true,
  "savedAt": 1234567890,
  "saveId": "abc123"
}
\`\`\`

**Error Responses**:
- `401 Unauthorized` - Invalid or missing auth token
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid save data or checksum mismatch
- `429 Too Many Requests` - Rate limit exceeded (max 1 save per 5 seconds)
```

## style guide

### markdown conventions

**Headings**
```markdown
✅ Correct:
# tomeclicker
## getting started
### installation steps

❌ Incorrect:
# TomeClicker
## Getting Started
### Installation Steps
```

**Code Blocks**
- Always specify language for syntax highlighting
- Include comments in examples
- Show both input and output when relevant

```markdown
✅ Good:
\`\`\`typescript
// Calculate total click value with all multipliers
const clickValue = baseValue * clickMultiplier * levelBonus;
console.log(clickValue); // Output: 150
\`\`\`

❌ Bad:
\`\`\`
const clickValue = baseValue * clickMultiplier * levelBonus;
\`\`\`
```

**Lists**
- Use `-` for unordered lists
- Use `1.` for ordered lists (auto-numbering)
- Indent nested lists with 2 spaces
- Add blank lines between complex list items

**Links**
```markdown
✅ Good: See [game design document](design/OUTLINE.md) for details
✅ Good: Visit [Claude Code docs](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code)

❌ Bad: See game design document (link missing)
❌ Bad: Visit https://docs.claude.com/claude-code (naked URL)
```

### code comment conventions

**Good Comments** (Explain WHY):
```typescript
// Use logarithmic scaling to prevent level inflation at high EXP values
const level = Math.floor(Math.log10(exp) / 3) + 1;

// Force Svelte reactivity after mutating nested object
game = game;

// Debounce saves to prevent localStorage thrashing on rapid clicks
const debouncedSave = debounce(saveGame, 300);
```

**Bad Comments** (State the obvious):
```typescript
// Increment the counter
counter++;

// Return the result
return result;

// Loop through the array
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
```
