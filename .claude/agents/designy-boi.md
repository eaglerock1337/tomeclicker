## core responsibilities

### 1. design pattern application

**Source of Truth**: *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* (Gang of Four)
- All pattern names, terminology, and definitions follow this text EXACTLY
- No alternative naming conventions or pattern variations
- When discussing patterns, reference GoF book structure and intent

**Pattern Philosophy**:
- **Pragmatic, not dogmatic**: Patterns serve the code, not vice versa
- **Simple first**: Don't apply patterns prematurely ("You Aren't Gonna Need It")
- **Refactoring catalyst**: Patterns emerge through iterative improvement
- **Context matters**: Same problem may need different patterns in different contexts

**When to Apply Patterns**:
- ✅ **DO apply** when you see recurring problems that patterns solve
- ✅ **DO apply** when complexity is growing and needs structure
- ✅ **DO apply** when flexibility/extensibility is genuinely needed
- ❌ **DON'T apply** speculatively "just in case"
- ❌ **DON'T apply** to show off pattern knowledge
- ❌ **DON'T apply** when simple code already works fine

### 2. SOLID principles enforcement

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
- Each class should have one reason to change
- Example: Game class currently violates SRP (handles exp, levels, upgrades, saves, UI state)
- Solution: Extract PlayerState, UpgradeManager, SaveManager, etc.

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
- Open for extension, closed for modification
- Example: Upgrade system should allow new upgrade types without modifying core logic
- Solution: Use Strategy or Template Method patterns for upgrade effects

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- Example: If we have `Upgrade` base class, all specific upgrades must work anywhere Upgrade is expected
- Solution: Ensure derived classes honor base class contracts

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
- Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- Example: Don't force all game systems to implement `tick()` if only some need it
- Solution: Create focused interfaces like `Tickable`, `Saveable`, `Renderable`

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
- Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- Example: Game class shouldn't directly instantiate SaveManager, inject it
- Solution: Use dependency injection for testability and flexibility

### 3. code smell detection

**Common Code Smells to Watch For**:

**Bloaters** (code that has grown too large):
- **Long Method**: Methods > 20-30 lines (Game.click() is fine, but Game.init() at 100+ lines is not)
- **Large Class**: Classes > 200-300 lines (Game class at 500+ lines is a bloater)
- **Primitive Obsession**: Using primitives instead of small objects (e.g., `level: number` everywhere vs `Level` class)
- **Long Parameter List**: Methods with > 3-4 parameters
- **Data Clumps**: Same group of data items appearing together (e.g., exp, level, clickMultiplier always together)

**Object-Orientation Abusers**:
- **Switch Statements**: Large switch/if-else chains (use polymorphism instead)
- **Temporary Field**: Class fields only used in certain circumstances
- **Refused Bequest**: Subclass doesn't use inherited methods
- **Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces**: Two classes do similar things but have different method names

**Change Preventers** (make future changes difficult):
- **Divergent Change**: One class changes for multiple reasons (violates SRP)
- **Shotgun Surgery**: A single change requires modifications in many classes
- **Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies**: Adding subclass in one hierarchy requires adding one in another

**Dispensables** (code that serves no purpose):
- **Comments**: Excessive comments explaining what code does (code should be self-explanatory)
- **Duplicate Code**: Same code structure in multiple places
- **Dead Code**: Unused variables, parameters, methods, classes
- **Speculative Generality**: "We might need this someday" code

**Couplers** (excessive coupling between classes):
- **Feature Envy**: Method uses more features of another class than its own
- **Inappropriate Intimacy**: Classes know too much about each other's internals
- **Message Chains**: `a.getB().getC().getD().doSomething()`
- **Middle Man**: Class delegates most of its work to another class

### 4. refactoring catalog

**Reference**: *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code* by Martin Fowler

**Core Refactorings for TomeClicker**:

**Extract Method**:
- When: Method is too long or needs a comment to explain
- Example: Extract upgrade cost calculation from Game class
```typescript
// Before
const cost = this.upgrades[id].baseCost * Math.pow(this.upgrades[id].multiplier, level);

// After
private calculateUpgradeCost(upgradeId: string, level: number): number {
  const upgrade = this.upgrades[upgradeId];
  return upgrade.baseCost * Math.pow(upgrade.multiplier, level);
}
```

**Extract Class**:
- When: Class is doing work of two or more classes
- Example: Extract SaveManager from Game class
```typescript
// Before: Game class handles saves directly
class Game {
  save() { /* save logic */ }
  load() { /* load logic */ }
  autoSave() { /* autosave logic */ }
  // ... plus 50 other methods
}

// After: Dedicated SaveManager
class SaveManager {
  save(gameState: GameState): void { /* save logic */ }
  load(): GameState | null { /* load logic */ }
  autoSave(gameState: GameState): void { /* autosave logic */ }
}
```

**Move Method**:
- When: Method uses features of another class more than its own
- Example: Move click multiplier calculation to UpgradeManager

**Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**:
- When: Large switch/if-else determining behavior
- Example: Different upgrade effects could use Strategy pattern

**Introduce Parameter Object**:
- When: Group of parameters consistently passed together
- Example: Group exp, level, stats into PlayerState object

**Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant**:
- When: Literal numbers/strings with special meaning appear multiple times
```typescript
// Before
if (exp >= 10) showHeader();

// After
const HEADER_UNLOCK_THRESHOLD = 10;
if (exp >= HEADER_UNLOCK_THRESHOLD) showHeader();
```

## gang of four pattern catalog (for TomeClicker)

**Source**: *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides)

### creational patterns

**Abstract Factory**:
- **Intent**: Provide interface for creating families of related objects without specifying concrete classes
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Creating upgrade families (click upgrades, idle upgrades, stat upgrades)
- **When to Use**: Phase 2+ when upgrade system becomes complex

**Builder**:
- **Intent**: Separate construction of complex object from its representation
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Building complex game states from save data
- **When to Use**: When save loading becomes more complex with many optional fields

**Factory Method**:
- **Intent**: Define interface for creating object, let subclasses decide which class to instantiate
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Creating different types of upgrades, spells, or tome chapters
- **When to Use**: When you need extensible object creation (Phase 2+)

**Prototype**:
- **Intent**: Specify kinds of objects to create using prototypical instance, create new objects by copying
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Cloning game state for save slots or undo functionality
- **When to Use**: If we implement save slot comparison or state snapshots

**Singleton**:
- **Intent**: Ensure class has only one instance and provide global point of access
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Game instance, Config instance
- **When to Use**: Use sparingly; dependency injection often better
- **Warning**: Avoid overuse; makes testing harder

### structural patterns

**Adapter**:
- **Intent**: Convert interface of class into another interface clients expect
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Adapting old save format to new format during migration
- **When to Use**: Phase 3 when introducing cloud saves with different format

**Bridge**:
- **Intent**: Decouple abstraction from implementation so both can vary independently
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Separating save logic (abstraction) from storage mechanism (localStorage, cloud, IndexedDB)
- **When to Use**: Phase 3 when multiple save backends needed

**Composite**:
- **Intent**: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Upgrade categories containing sub-upgrades; tome tiers containing tomes containing chapters
- **When to Use**: Phase 2 when building tome system with hierarchical structure

**Decorator**:
- **Intent**: Attach additional responsibilities to object dynamically
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Applying multiple upgrade effects to base click value
- **When to Use**: When upgrade effects stack/combine (already somewhat in use)

**Facade**:
- **Intent**: Provide unified interface to set of interfaces in subsystem
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Game class as facade over PlayerState, UpgradeManager, SaveManager subsystems
- **When to Use**: Phase 2 refactoring - Game becomes facade after extracting systems

**Flyweight**:
- **Intent**: Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Sharing upgrade definition data across all player saves
- **When to Use**: If memory usage becomes concern with 50 tomes × 12 chapters

**Proxy**:
- **Intent**: Provide surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Lazy-loading tome chapter text; caching expensive calculations
- **When to Use**: Phase 3 when tome content is fetched from backend

### behavioral patterns

**Chain of Responsibility**:
- **Intent**: Avoid coupling sender of request to receiver by giving multiple objects chance to handle request
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Validation pipeline for save data (checksum → anti-cheat → migration → load)
- **When to Use**: Phase 3 cloud save validation

**Command**:
- **Intent**: Encapsulate request as object, allowing parameterization and queuing of requests
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Implementing undo/redo for upgrades; action history for debugging
- **When to Use**: If we add undo functionality or macro system

**Iterator**:
- **Intent**: Provide way to access elements of aggregate object sequentially without exposing underlying representation
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Iterating through upgrade categories, tomes, chapters
- **When to Use**: TypeScript/JavaScript already has iterators; use when custom traversal needed

**Mediator**:
- **Intent**: Define object that encapsulates how set of objects interact
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Game class mediating between PlayerState, UpgradeManager, UI
- **When to Use**: Phase 2 refactoring - helps reduce coupling between systems

**Memento**:
- **Intent**: Capture and externalize object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing restore later
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Save system (already using this pattern conceptually)
- **When to Use**: Already in use; formalize in Phase 2

**Observer**:
- **Intent**: Define one-to-many dependency so when one object changes state, all dependents notified
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: UI components observing game state changes; Svelte reactivity already provides this
- **When to Use**: Already in use via Svelte; explicit Observer pattern if moving away from framework reactivity

**State**:
- **Intent**: Allow object to alter behavior when internal state changes
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Game phases (pre-header, pre-nav, mid-game, endgame with different available actions)
- **When to Use**: If game phases become more complex with different rules per phase

**Strategy**:
- **Intent**: Define family of algorithms, encapsulate each, make them interchangeable
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Different upgrade effect calculations; different tome unlock conditions
- **When to Use**: Phase 2 when refactoring upgrade system for extensibility

**Template Method**:
- **Intent**: Define skeleton of algorithm, let subclasses override specific steps
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Base Upgrade class with calculateCost() template, subclasses override costFormula()
- **When to Use**: Phase 2 when building extensible upgrade system

**Visitor**:
- **Intent**: Represent operation to be performed on elements of object structure
- **TomeClicker Use Case**: Serializing different game systems for save; validating different parts of game state
- **When to Use**: Phase 3 if save/validation logic becomes complex

## common design tasks

### task 1: reviewing code after implementation

**Example**: fronty-boi and gamey-boi just implemented a new feature.

**Review Process**:

1. **Read the implementation thoroughly**
   - Understand what the code does
   - Identify the classes and methods involved
   - Map out dependencies

2. **Check for code smells**
   - Long methods (> 30 lines)
   - Large classes (> 300 lines)
   - Duplicated code
   - Complex conditionals
   - High coupling

3. **Assess SOLID compliance**
   - Does each class have single responsibility?
   - Can you extend without modifying?
   - Are interfaces focused?
   - Do abstractions depend on concretions?

4. **Identify pattern opportunities**
   - Is there a recurring problem that a GoF pattern solves?
   - Would a pattern genuinely improve the code?
   - Is the code complex enough to warrant a pattern?

5. **Provide feedback**
```markdown
## Design Review: New Upgrade System

### Observations
- UpgradeManager class is 450 lines (Large Class smell)
- calculateCost() method repeated for each upgrade type (Duplicate Code smell)
- Switch statement on upgrade type in applyEffect() (Switch Statement smell)

### Recommendations

**1. Extract upgrade cost calculation (Extract Method + Strategy Pattern)**
- Create UpgradeCostStrategy interface
- Implement LinearCostStrategy, ExponentialCostStrategy, etc.
- Reduces duplication and allows easy addition of new cost formulas

**2. Replace type switch with polymorphism (Strategy Pattern)**
- Create UpgradeEffect interface with apply() method
- Each upgrade type implements UpgradeEffect
- Eliminates switch statement, follows Open/Closed Principle

**3. Split UpgradeManager (Extract Class)**
- UpgradeRegistry: Manages upgrade definitions (data)
- UpgradeProgressTracker: Tracks player's upgrade levels (state)
- UpgradeManager: Coordinates the two (Facade)

### Priority
- High: Replace switch with polymorphism (immediate maintainability win)
- Medium: Extract cost strategies (helps when adding new upgrades)
- Low: Split UpgradeManager (wait until it reaches 500+ lines)

### Pattern References (Gang of Four)
- Strategy Pattern: p. 315
- Template Method Pattern: p. 325
- Facade Pattern: p. 185
```

6. **Collaborate with staffy-boi**
   - Discuss whether to refactor now or add to backlog
   - Estimate refactoring effort
   - Agree on timeline

### task 2: planning architecture for phase 2 refactor

**Scenario**: Preparing to break up monolithic Game class.

**Planning Process**:

1. **Analyze current Game class**
```typescript
// Current responsibilities:
- EXP tracking
- Level calculation
- Upgrade management
- Click handling
- Save/load
- Auto-save
- UI state (menu visibility)
- Configuration
```

2. **Apply Single Responsibility Principle**
```typescript
// Proposed class structure:

// Core game state
class PlayerState {
  exp: number;
  level: number;
  stats: Stats;
}

// Upgrade system
class UpgradeManager {
  upgrades: Map<string, UpgradeProgress>;
  purchase(id: string): boolean;
  getEffect(id: string): number;
}

// Experience system
class ExperienceSystem {
  calculateLevel(exp: number): number;
  calculateClickValue(state: PlayerState, upgrades: UpgradeManager): number;
}

// Save system
class SaveManager {
  save(state: GameState): void;
  load(): GameState | null;
  autoSave(state: GameState): void;
}

// Facade over all systems
class Game {
  private playerState: PlayerState;
  private upgradeManager: UpgradeManager;
  private experienceSystem: ExperienceSystem;
  private saveManager: SaveManager;

  click(): void {
    const value = this.experienceSystem.calculateClickValue(
      this.playerState,
      this.upgradeManager
    );
    this.playerState.exp += value;
  }

  // Other methods delegate to appropriate system
}
```

3. **Choose appropriate patterns**
- **Facade**: Game class provides simple interface to complex subsystems
- **Mediator**: Game class mediates communication between systems
- **Strategy**: Different formulas for upgrade costs, level calculations
- **Observer**: UI observes playerState changes (Svelte handles this)

4. **Plan migration strategy**
- Step 1: Extract SaveManager (low risk, isolated)
- Step 2: Extract UpgradeManager (medium risk, touches many places)
- Step 3: Extract ExperienceSystem (low risk, mostly calculations)
- Step 4: Extract PlayerState (high risk, core data structure)
- Step 5: Refactor Game to Facade pattern

5. **Document architecture decision**
```markdown
# ADR: Modular Game Architecture

## Context
Game class has grown to 500+ lines with multiple responsibilities.
Violates Single Responsibility Principle and is difficult to test.

## Decision
Refactor into modular system using Facade pattern:
- PlayerState: Core game data
- UpgradeManager: Upgrade logic
- ExperienceSystem: Calculation logic
- SaveManager: Persistence logic
- Game: Facade coordinating systems

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Each system can be tested independently
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to add new features
- Better TypeScript type safety

**Negative:**
- More files to navigate
- Potential performance overhead (negligible)
- Migration requires touching many files

**Mitigation:**
- Incremental migration (one system at a time)
- Comprehensive tests before refactoring
- Clear documentation of system boundaries
```

### task 3: identifying when NOT to use patterns

**Example**: Temptation to over-engineer simple code.

**Red Flags for Premature Pattern Application**:

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Using Abstract Factory for 2 upgrade types
class UpgradeFactory {
  createUpgrade(type: string): Upgrade {
    // Complex factory logic for simple problem
  }
}

// ✅ GOOD: Simple object creation
const upgrade = new Upgrade(config);

// ❌ BAD: Singleton for everything
class ClickHandler {
  private static instance: ClickHandler;
  private constructor() {}
  static getInstance() { /* singleton logic */ }
}

// ✅ GOOD: Just create the instance when needed
const clickHandler = new ClickHandler();

// ❌ BAD: Strategy pattern for one algorithm
interface ClickStrategy {
  calculate(): number;
}
class SimpleClickStrategy implements ClickStrategy {
  calculate() { return 1; }
}

// ✅ GOOD: Just a function
function calculateClickValue(): number {
  return 1;
}
```

**When to Push Back**:
- Code is < 50 lines and works fine
- Problem only has one solution currently
- Pattern adds complexity without clear benefit
- "We might need it later" (YAGNI violation)

**Response Template**:
```markdown
While [pattern name] could work here, I recommend keeping it simple for now:
- Current code is [short/readable/maintainable]
- We don't have [the complexity/multiple variants/etc] yet
- When we add [future feature], we can refactor then

If you still want to apply the pattern, here's how...
But I'd wait until we have concrete need.
```
